# MasterSelects Agent Instructions

Repository instructions for all coding agents working on MasterSelects: the
Claude orchestrator, Codex workers, and any other agent.

`AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are intentionally byte-identical. When anything in
here changes, update both files to the same content (`Copy-Item CLAUDE.md
AGENTS.md` or equivalent). Parity check: `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md`.

---

## 1. Working Principles

- Never assume you are the only person or agent working in the current branch.
  Treat all unrelated changes as someone else's active work: never revert,
  overwrite, clean up, reformat, or otherwise undo changes you did not make
  unless the user explicitly asks for that exact operation.
- Think long term. Build the real target architecture, not MVPs, mocks, or
  throwaway prototypes, when the robust solution is directly reachable.
  Short-term hacks only on explicit user request or a hard technical blocker.
  The project moves fast with AI-powered development and has no external users
  blocked by changes; large, correct architectural decisions are preferred.
- Project goal (June 2026): every file becomes a visual signal — video, audio,
  images, 3D (OBJ/FBX/glTF), documents (PDF/SVG), CAD (DXF/STEP), data
  (JSON/CSV/binary/point clouds). There are no "unsupported" files: everything
  becomes texture, geometry, or data, can be placed on the timeline,
  composited, and exported.

---

## 2. Orchestration Model

Decided 2026-06-09. One Claude Code session acts as master orchestrator;
OpenAI Codex CLI agents are dispatched as headless workers via `codex exec`
(gpt-5.5, xhigh reasoning, fast tier — the user-level Codex defaults).

| Role | Owns |
|---|---|
| Orchestrator (Claude) | Packet specs (lane, goal, write set, forbidden files, checks, stop conditions), dispatch, post-packet verification (focused vitest + diff review), gate closure, queue/lane strategy, ALL git commits, merges and pushes |
| Workers (Codex) | Source edits, `npx tsc -b` + scoped rg scans, checklist/queue bookkeeping in repo style, packet report |

Rules:

- Workers never commit, never push, never merge, never self-extend scope.
  Extra debt found mid-packet is reported, not fixed.
- Verified sandbox limits: the Codex sandbox cannot run vitest (esbuild
  `spawn EPERM`) and cannot write `.git/index.lock` (no `git add`/`commit`).
  Workers must not claim test results; read-only git is fine. The orchestrator
  runs the focused test suite after each packet, commits verified waves, and
  reverts or dispatches a fix-forward packet when red.
- Up to 6 parallel workers, only with disjoint write sets. At most one
  concurrently running worker may hold
  `docs/ongoing/Complete-refactor-checklist.md` and
  `docs/ongoing/complete-refactor/execution-queue-and-lanes.md` in its write
  set; other parallel workers return reports only.
- Claude-side dispatch mechanics: `~/.claude/skills/codex-worker/SKILL.md`.
- Doppelspitze (MCP, skill, agent bus, file-lock bus, lead-a/lead-b
  coordination, handoff/logging) stays disabled for this repository unless the
  user explicitly re-enables it. Coordinate through the checklist, the active
  queue, and normal chat updates.

## 3. Command Modes

### Fast commands (explicit exceptions to all check/doc/version rules)

`fast commit`:

1. Stage everything including untracked files: `git add -A`.
2. Commit without build, lint, or tests.
3. No doc updates, no version bump, no changelog.
4. Use the user's commit message if present; otherwise derive from the diff.

`fast push`:

1. If the worktree is dirty, `fast commit` first.
2. Push the current branch; `git push -u origin <branch>` if no upstream.
3. No checks, no docs, no versioning.

`fast merge`:

1. If dirty, `fast commit` first; push the source branch (set upstream if
   needed).
2. `git fetch origin`; switch to local `master`; bring it to `origin/master`.
3. Merge the source branch directly into `master`; push `master` directly.
4. No PR, no `staging` detour (unless staging is the source), no waiting for
   GitHub checks, no checks/version/changelog.
5. On merge conflict: stop and report. Never auto-resolve by guessing.

### Normal commands

Anything not using a `fast ...` command:

- Full chain before normal commit, push, release, merge, or final readiness:
  `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`. Do not commit if any fail.
- Do not rerun the chain if it already passed on the exact same HEAD after the
  latest changes; reuse the result and say so.
- Feature, UI, workflow, architecture, or user-visible behavior changes update
  the relevant docs in `docs/Features/`.
- Normal merges to `master` bump version + changelog (section 5).

---

## 4. Branches, Issues, And Check Budget

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `staging` | development, default target for ongoing work |
| `master` | production |

- Never commit directly to `master`, never merge to `master` independently,
  never push independently — except: fast commands, issue branches (below), or
  direct explicit user instruction.
- Issue workflow: comment "I am on it" → assign `sportinger` → create and link
  an issue branch → clone it into a separate folder and work from there →
  implement, test, repeat → commit and push to the issue branch at the agent's
  discretion when the work is coherent and locally checked → merge to `master`
  only after the user confirms everything works (no waiting for GitHub
  checks) → comment the result on the issue.
- Check budget: during ongoing work run focused unit/smoke tests, targeted
  builds, or lint proportional to risk and change scope. Do not run the full
  chain after every small edit; it is mandatory only at the normal-command
  boundaries above. Refactor packet commits on issue branches follow the
  bounded-packet checks defined in the queue, plus orchestrator test
  verification.
- Large command outputs are token- and time-expensive: report short summaries
  and relevant error lines, not full logs.
- Prefer small, coherent changes and packet-sized commits.

### Normal merge to master (only on explicit user request)

1. Required checks green on the exact HEAD being merged (reuse if already
   green).
2. Bump version + changelog, commit, push.
3. PR from the source branch to `master` unless a direct merge is requested.
4. Bring `staging` back to the current `master` state when the workflow uses
   staging.

---

## 5. Version And Changelog Locations

When intentionally bumping the release version, check all of these:

- `src/version.ts`: `APP_VERSION`; `FEATURED_VIDEO.banner.title`/`.message`
  and `BUILD_NOTICE.title`/`.message` when they contain the version or name
  the release.
- `src/changelog-data.json`: add release notes at the beginning.
- `package.json`: top-level `"version"`.
- `package-lock.json`: top-level `"version"` and `packages[""].version`.

Consistency scan before a normal release:

```bash
rg -n "APP_VERSION|MasterSelects [0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+|\"version\": \"[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\"" src package.json package-lock.json
```

Fast commands never bump versions or update the changelog unless the user
explicitly adds that request.

---

## 6. Complete Refactor

The repo-wide Complete Refactor is the active architecture initiative. Do not
restart meta-planning; read the plan and execute the next bounded packet.

1. `docs/ongoing/Complete-refactor.md` — plan and orchestrator index
2. `docs/ongoing/Complete-refactor-checklist.md` — user-visible status source
3. `docs/ongoing/complete-refactor/execution-queue-and-lanes.md` — active queue

Rules:

- Every source change needs a lane, write set, forbidden files, gate/check,
  and a short report. No broad unscoped refactors.
- Foundation lanes come first: shared types/barrels, runtime leases, project
  persistence, and dev-bridge quarantine before domain refactors.
- Product-source ceiling is 700 LOC, with smaller role-specific budgets in the
  plan. Splits must reduce real coupling — no `helpers.ts`/`utils.ts`/broad
  `types.ts` dumping grounds, no blind line-count splits.
- Runtime handles (File, Blob, object URLs, DOM/media elements, AudioContext,
  VideoFrame, ImageBitmap, GPU objects, decoders, workers, service singletons)
  stay out of durable stores, project data, pure shared types, and
  cross-domain schema tiers.
- Keep the checklist current in the same session whenever requirements, lanes,
  gates, blockers, or verification needs change. Keep the queue file an active
  queue (active packet + next few queued), not a history archive; completed
  packets collapse to checklist lines.
- If a needed gate, contract, or write set is missing, add the smallest
  preflight entry to plan/checklist, then continue with the bounded packet.
- Timeline is a protected lane: `src/stores/timeline/**`,
  `src/components/timeline/**`, and `src/timeline/architecture/**` are
  read-only except for explicit integration packets. Completed timeline
  architecture docs live under `docs/completed/architecture/`.

## 7. Quick Reference

```bash
npm install && npm run dev    # dev server (default)
npm run dev:changelog         # only when the changelog dialog is needed
npm run build                 # production builds show the changelog automatically
npm run build:deploy
npm run lint
npm run test                  # plus test:watch / test:unit / test:ui / test:coverage
npm run preview
```

Native helper (WebSocket port 9876, HTTP port 9877):

```bash
cd tools/native-helper && cargo run --release
```

Windows MSI builds bundle `yt-dlp.exe`; source builds and non-Windows archives
use `yt-dlp` next to the helper binary or from `PATH`.

## 8. Architecture Map

- `src/components/`: React UI — Timeline, Panels, Preview, Docking, Export, Mobile
- `src/stores/`: Zustand stores — Timeline, Media, History, Settings, Dock, Slice, Render Targets, SAM2, Multicam
- `src/engine/`: WebGPU rendering, RenderDispatcher, texture/audio/export/analysis pipeline
- `src/effects/`, `src/transitions/`: GPU effects and transitions
- `src/services/`: business logic — LayerBuilder, Media Runtime, Monitoring, Project Storage, AI Tools, Export
- `src/signals/`, `src/importers/`: Universal Signal foundation ("no unsupported files")
- `src/hooks/`, `src/utils/`, `src/types/`, `src/workers/`, `src/shaders/`

Especially central files: `src/engine/WebGPUEngine.ts`,
`src/engine/render/RenderDispatcher.ts`, `src/stores/timeline/index.ts`,
`src/stores/mediaStore/index.ts`, `src/stores/historyStore.ts`,
`src/services/layerBuilder/LayerBuilderService.ts`, `src/services/logger.ts`,
`src/engine/featureFlags.ts`.

Render path:

```text
useEngine -> WebGPUEngine.initialize() -> RenderLoop.start()
  -> RenderDispatcher.render(layers)
     -> LayerCollector -> Compositor/Effects -> NestedCompRenderer
     -> OutputPipeline -> SlicePipeline
```

More context: `README.md`, `docs/Features/README.md`.

## 9. Critical Patterns

HMR singletons (Engine, FFmpegBridge, SAM2, runtime owners) must survive HMR:

```ts
let instance: MyService | null = null;

if (import.meta.hot) {
  import.meta.hot.accept();
  if (import.meta.hot.data?.myService) {
    instance = import.meta.hot.data.myService;
  }
  import.meta.hot.dispose((data) => {
    data.myService = instance;
  });
}
```

Avoid stale closures — read fresh state through `get()` or functional updates
in async callbacks:

```ts
video.onload = () => {
  const current = get().layers;
  set({ layers: current.map(...) });
};
```

- Wait for `canplaythrough`, not only `loadeddata`.
- Prefer functional `setState` updates; use lazy state initialization for
  expensive setup.
- Use `toSorted()` instead of `sort()` to avoid mutation.
- All stores use `subscribeWithSelector`; `settingsStore` and `dockStore` also
  use `persist`; `mediaStore` uses a slice-creator signature that differs from
  Timeline.

### Linux / Mesa GPU canvas constraints (read before any canvas/GPU change)

We develop on Windows; many users run open-source Mesa (RADV/radeonsi/NVK/
llvmpipe), where GPU-accelerated `<canvas>`, worker `OffscreenCanvas`, and
WebGPU paths fail **silently** — no throw, no null, diagnostics report success,
the pixels just never composite. This is the top recurring "works here, blank on
Linux" regression class. New/refactored canvas or GPU code MUST design for it,
not patch it after shipping. Rules:

- Size scrolling canvases to the **visible viewport + overscan** and slide with
  scroll; never allocate the full content width/height (blanks at zoom on Mesa).
- Clamp the backing store (`width*dpr`, `height*dpr`) well below the hardware
  max (use 8192; `MAX_TEXTURE_SIZE` is not a safe target).
- Treat worker `OffscreenCanvas` as an optimization with a real, exercised
  main-thread fallback; on Linux prefer a software raster
  (`getContext('2d', { willReadFrequently: true })`).
- Route platform decisions through `prefersSoftwareTimelineCanvas()`
  (`src/components/timeline/utils/timelineCanvasPlatform.ts`); don't scatter
  `navigator.platform` checks.
- Never trust silent success — completed draw calls or `getImageData` pixels do
  not prove the canvas is on screen.

Full reference and failure-mode table: `docs/Features/Linux-Mesa-GPU.md`.

## 10. Debugging

Logger:

```ts
import { Logger } from '@/services/logger';
const log = Logger.create('ModuleName');
```

Browser console: `Logger.enable('WebGPU,FFmpeg')`, `Logger.enable('*')`,
`Logger.setLevel('DEBUG')`, `Logger.search('device')`, `Logger.errors()`,
`Logger.dump(50)`, `Logger.summary()`.

### AI debug bridge

`POST http://localhost:5173/api/ai-tools` (dev server running, app open in a
browser). Bearer token from `.ai-bridge-token`:

```powershell
$token = Get-Content -Path .ai-bridge-token -Raw
$headers = @{ Authorization = "Bearer $token"; 'Content-Type' = 'application/json' }
$body = @{ tool = 'getStats'; args = @{} } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 4
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri 'http://localhost:5173/api/ai-tools' -Method Post -Headers $headers -Body $body
```

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `getStats` / `getStatsHistory` | engine snapshot(s): FPS, timing, decoder, drops, audio, GPU |
| `getLogs` | filtered browser logs (`limit`, `level`, `module`, `search`) |
| `getPlaybackTrace` | WebCodecs/VF pipeline events plus health state |
| `simulateScrub` / `simulatePlayback` / `simulatePlaybackPath` | playback repros |
| `getClipDetails`, `reloadApp` | inspection / hard reload |
| `debugExport` | dev-bridge-only export probe (runs FrameExporter in the real browser) |

`debugExport` key facts: pass `maxRuntimeMs` so a hanging export aborts
cleanly; a returned blob with `size > 0` means the browser export path works
(then investigate ExportPanel, download handling, preset or progress state);
`WebGPU device lost` plus `renderLoop.isRunning=false` afterwards means a
stale device state — `reloadApp` first, then retest; video-only timelines must
skip audio (a long hang at "Rendering audio" points to broken audio range
detection). NativeHelper WebSocket warnings matter only when the tested path
actually needs the helper.

For timeline, playback, render, or export bugs: inspect logs, traces, and
`src/services/monitoring/` (playbackHealthMonitor, playbackDebugStats,
framePhaseMonitor, wcPipelineMonitor, vfPipelineMonitor, scrubSettleState)
before editing. Browser globals: `window.__WC_PIPELINE__`,
`window.__VF_PIPELINE__`. Useful module sets:
`Logger.enable('WebCodecsPlayer,PlaybackHealth,LayerCollector')` and
`Logger.enable('VideoSyncManager,ParallelDecode,RenderLoop')`.

Details: `docs/Features/Debugging.md`, `docs/Features/Playback-Debugging.md`.

## 11. Practical Rules

- Read context before editing. For larger feature changes, check impact on
  `docs/Features/`, version/changelog locations, and tests.
- When a request matches an available skill or tool of your harness, prefer it
  over manual speculation (e.g. the `masterselects` skill for editor
  automation, the AI bridge for playback/export repros).
- Keep `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` byte-identical.
