# Audio

[<- Back to Index](./README.md)

Audio in MasterSelects is split into two paths:
live playback sync for timeline editing, and offline audio processing for export.

---

## Playback Overview

- Video imports can create linked audio clips when audio is detected.
- Audio-only files are added as audio clips on audio tracks.
- Default timeline tracks include two video tracks and one audio track.
- Live playback uses HTMLMediaElement timing plus drift correction, not a separate audio master clock.

## Live Playback

The main runtime path is `LayerBuilderService` -> `AudioTrackSyncManager` -> `AudioSyncHandler`.
`useLayerSync` still contains a direct playback sync path with the same basic rules.

- Playback rate follows clip speed, clamped to the browser-safe range of 0.25x to 4x.
- Audio is muted for reverse or other non-standard playback speeds.
- `preservesPitch` is applied from the clip setting, defaulting to on.
- Scrubbing is snippet-based and throttled; it is not continuous time-stretched scrub audio.
- Current drift is corrected when the element gets too far from the expected time.
- Same-source sequential audio clips can hand off to the previous element, and upcoming clips may be pre-buffered before they hit the playhead.
- Nested composition mixdown audio and proxy audio are synced through the same runtime path.
- Audio status is tracked as `playing`, `drift`, `silent`, or `error` for performance stats.
- Timeline track headers and the master bus show runtime Peak/RMS meters. Meter snapshots are collected from the live Web Audio route or the varispeed scrub graph, aggregated in `runtimeAudioMeters`, and are never serialized into project files.
- Audio track headers expose Aux send controls inline with track volume, pan, mute/solo, meters, and FX. Sends can be added, bypassed, routed to a target bus id, switched pre/post fader, and removed without leaving the timeline.
- The docked `Audio Mixer` view is available from the main View menu. It mirrors the same timeline-native track and master state with dense track strips for mute/solo, record-arm, input monitor, faders, pan, meters, sends, track FX, master FX, limiter, and export preflight.
- Live playback folds enabled Aux sends into the same master-return gain model used by export: post-fader sends follow track volume, pre-fader sends bypass it, disabled sends are ignored.
- Audio track headers expose `R` record-arm and `I` input-monitor toggles. The timeline toolbar record button starts from the current playhead for armed audio tracks.

## Audio Effects

Audio clip controls live in the Properties panel under the `Effects` tab.
For audio clips, that tab renders the `VolumeTab`.

- Volume is stored as the `audio-volume` effect and displayed in dB.
- EQ is stored as the `audio-eq` effect with 10 bands: 31, 62, 125, 250, 500, 1k, 2k, 4k, 8k, 16k.
- `AudioEffectRegistry` is the source of truth for audio effect descriptors, defaults, automation metadata, and render support.
- Registered professional effects now include high-pass filter, low-pass filter, compressor, de-esser, limiter, noise gate, delay, and reverb in addition to volume and EQ.
- Offline rendering applies registry-backed effect instances through `AudioEffectRenderer`; Web Audio nodes cover EQ, gain, filters, compressor, and split-band de-essing, while deterministic sample-domain processors cover limiter, noise gate, delay, and reverb. Clip processed analysis and export use this same renderer through `ClipAudioRenderService`.
- The audio Properties tab exposes a registry-backed `Audio FX Stack` for adding, reordering, bypassing, removing, and editing clip `audioState.effectStack` effects. Static default effects stay no-op; non-default signal-shaping params invalidate only processed analysis refs.
- Static and automated `audio-volume` changes are handled as output/display gain. They do not invalidate source artifacts or processed waveform/spectrogram/loudness/beat/frequency refs; EQ, filter, compressor, limiter, noise-gate, speed, reverse, and edit-stack changes remain signal-shaping and invalidate processed refs.
- The `Keep Pitch` toggle maps to the clip-level `preservesPitch` flag.
- The tab auto-adds missing `audio-volume` and `audio-eq` effects when opened.

Live routing uses `audioRoutingManager` when EQ, pan, above-unity gain, Aux send gain, runtime metering, or browser-supported registry processors are active. Current live processors include high-pass, low-pass, compressor, de-esser, delay, and reverb. If a route is pure gain at or below unity and no meter is needed, playback falls back to direct `element.volume` updates.

## Waveforms

- Audio clips generate waveforms from decoded audio data.
- Source waveform pyramids and processed waveform pyramids can be stored as audio analysis artifacts.
- Source and processed loudness envelopes can be stored as artifact-backed LUFS/RMS/peak curve payloads with summary metrics.
- Source and processed beat grids/onset maps can be stored as artifact-backed spectral-flux event lists for node, repair, and edit workflows.
- Source and processed frequency summaries/phase-correlation maps can be stored as artifact-backed frequency-band and stereo-health payloads for node, repair, and visual workflows.
- Processed waveforms are generated through the same clip-local offline audio render path used by export, including trim, region edit-stack operations, reverse, speed/pitch, and signal-shaping processors such as EQ. Clip volume, including volume automation, is treated as output/display gain so changing loudness does not force heavy analysis regeneration.
- Processed analysis invalidation is scoped to signal-shaping changes. Cache-neutral `audioState` metadata patches and pure `audio-volume` effect-stack updates keep processed refs reusable; edit stacks, spectral layers, mute, source revision, speed/reverse, and non-default signal-shaping effects invalidate processed refs.
- Spectral Audio mode generates source or processed spectrogram tile artifacts on demand and renders those tiles directly in the timeline lane.
- Processed spectrograms are keyed by the same clip audio-state hash as processed waveforms, so edit-stack, speed, reverse, mute, and audio effects get their own stale-safe spectral display.
- Node Workspace audio ports can generate/refresh waveform, processed waveform, spectrogram, loudness, beat, onset, phase, and frequency-summary artifacts from the node inspector. AI/custom-node authoring and runtime context receive bounded artifact refs, cached loudness/frequency/phase summaries, and clip/track/master routing snapshots without exposing raw audio buffers.
- Spectrogram, loudness, beat/onset, and frequency/phase timeline jobs share `ClipAudioAnalysisOrchestrator` for source/processed buffer preparation and expose a semantic `audioAnalysisJob` while keeping the legacy waveform progress indicator compatible.
- Nested composition clips generate waveforms from the mixed-down buffer when available.
- Large files are skipped: audio-only files above 4 GB and video files above 500 MB.
- Legacy waveform generation uses the first channel only and normalizes peak data for display.

## Timeline Audio Editing

- `Audio Focus` is available from the Timeline `View` menu.
- Audio Focus keeps editing on the main timeline: video tracks remain visible as compact context, while audio tracks get larger lanes for detailed waveform work.
- In Audio Focus with `Detailed Audio`, dragging inside an audio clip creates an inline audio region selection.
- Region selections snap to nearby waveform valleys as a zero-cross-safe fallback when source waveform data is available.
- The inline region toolbar can copy/paste region metadata and add non-destructive edit-stack operations for silence, insert silence, delete silence, reverse, invert polarity, left/right channel swap, mono sum, and repair operations.
- Repair operations currently include 50 Hz hum notch filtering, de-click interpolation, splice-edge smoothing, and region RMS loudness matching. They are stored as `repair` edit-stack operations, so bypass, bake, processed analysis, and export all use the same path.
- In Audio Focus with `Spectral Audio`, dragging inside an audio clip creates a time/frequency selection over the inline spectrogram.
- The spectral region toolbar can add non-destructive `spectral-mask` or `spectral-resynthesis` edit-stack operations with bounded frequency metadata.
- The spectral region toolbar can also turn the selected Media panel image into an image-in-spectrum layer. Image layers are stored on `clip.audioState.spectralLayers`, rendered as overlays in the spectral lane, editable from the selected clip `Audio Edits` tab, keyframable for opacity/gain/frequency bounds, and can also be created by dropping an image from the Media panel onto the spectral hit area.
- `spectral-mask` operations render through the shared clip audio render path as deterministic band-limited attenuation, so processed waveforms, bake, and export hear the same edit.
- Image-in-spectrum layers render through `ClipAudioRenderService` by decoding image luminance/alpha into bounded time/frequency masks. Layer keyframes are evaluated during the same render path so animated gain/opacity/frequency bounds stay consistent across processed analysis, bake, and export. `attenuate`, `boost`, `gate`, `sidechain-mask`, and `replace` currently use deterministic, phase-preserving band operations.
- Edit-stack operations live on `clip.audioState.editStack`; they can be inspected from the Properties panel `Audio Edits` tab and bypassed, removed, cleared, or baked without mutating the original media file.
- Baking active edit-stack operations creates a new WAV media source, resets the clip edit stack, keeps the old source immutable, and records bake provenance in `audioState.bakeHistory`.

## Import And Detection

Video audio detection uses `detectVideoAudio()` with MediaBunny for MP4-based containers,
HTMLVideoElement probing as a fallback, and a light WebM/MKV header check.
If detection stays inconclusive, the code falls back to assuming audio exists.

Audio extraction for playback and export uses browser `decodeAudioData`, not MP4Box.

## Recording

`AudioRecordingService` records armed audio tracks through the browser input stack and commits the result back into the existing media/timeline pipeline.

- Track `recordArm`, `inputMonitor`, and optional `inputDeviceId` live on `TrackAudioState`.
- Recording can be controlled from either the timeline toolbar or the docked Audio Mixer. Both paths use the same `AudioRecordingService` and the same armed-track state.
- Starting recording groups armed tracks by input device, requests microphone input, prefers an `AudioWorklet` PCM capture backend, falls back to `MediaRecorder` when required, and stores active-session recovery metadata in local storage.
- AudioWorklet capture writes streamed `Float32` PCM chunks directly into 16-bit PCM WAV files through the shared audio file encoder, so it avoids a decode/re-encode pass and preserves sample-rate/channel metadata.
- MediaRecorder fallback captures browser-native chunks and transcodes to WAV when the browser can decode the recorded blob.
- Stopping recording prepares recorded audio files, imports the files into the Media panel with project-copy enabled, and adds audio clips at the original playhead start time.
- Timeline In/Out markers define punch recording. If the playhead is before the In marker, recording enters `waiting-for-punch`, starts capture when timeline time reaches In, and stops/commits automatically at Out.
- After commit, source waveform and loudness jobs are queued for each recorded clip so timeline display and Node/AI context can use the same artifact-backed analysis path as imported files.
- Active recording sessions checkpoint MediaRecorder chunks and bundled AudioWorklet PCM chunks into recovery artifacts. Stopped sessions also persist their final captured blobs until media import and clip creation succeed, so failed commits remain visible and can be retried from the Mixer recovery list. Cancelling recording stops media tracks and clears recovery metadata without adding clips.

## Multicam And Analysis

- `audioAnalyzer` provides RMS level curves and downsampled fingerprints.
- `audioSync` uses normalized cross-correlation to compute offsets.
- `MulticamDialog` and `multicamStore` use those offsets for clip alignment.
- Transcript-based sync exists separately when clip transcripts are available.

## Composition Mixdown

`compositionAudioMixer` mixes nested composition audio into a single buffer.
It also creates a playable WAV-backed `HTMLAudioElement` and a waveform for timeline display.
That mixdown buffer is reused by export when the composition is part of the export range.

## Export

Audio export is handled by `engine/audio`:
`AudioExportPipeline` -> `AudioGraphRenderer` -> `AudioExtractor` -> `ClipAudioRenderService` -> `AudioEffectRenderer` -> `AudioMixer` -> `AudioEncoderWrapper`.

- `FrameExporter` uses `AudioExportPipeline.exportAudio()` for normal video exports with audio.
- `FrameExporter` uses `AudioExportPipeline.exportRawAudio()` for the FFmpeg export path.
- `ExportPanel` also exposes standalone audio export through the same pipeline.
- Audio-only WAV export uses `exportRawAudio()` and writes a 16-bit PCM WAV file.
- The pipeline applies clip trimming, region edit-stack operations including paste/insert/delete silence, reverse, repair, spectral masks, speed changes, clip/track/master registry effects, track pan, graph-based mute/solo, enabled track sends as master-return mix entries, mixing, master fader, optional target-LUFS gain, final limiter/peak normalization, and then encoding.
- The Master bus popover includes Export Preflight `Check` and `Measure` actions. `Check` stores graph/static-state warnings on `masterAudioState.exportPreflight`; `Measure` renders the current export audio range and records integrated LUFS, true peak, sample peak, RMS, and loudness-target delta before adding measured clipping, true-peak, silence, and LUFS-target warnings.
- `AudioEncoderWrapper` prefers AAC-LC and falls back to Opus if the browser supports it.
- Peak normalization is optional and only happens during export when enabled.

Important limitation:
the WebCodecs audio encoder is required for the standalone browser-compressed audio path.
Audio-only WAV export does not require WebCodecs audio encoding.
FFmpeg exports can still receive raw audio because they use `exportRawAudio()`.

## Limitations

- No broadband noise reduction.
- Runtime meters cover live Peak/RMS track and master previews. Offline loudness analysis remains artifact-based for LUFS/history/detail views.
- Recording persists active/stopped/error recovery metadata, stores active chunks and stopped capture blobs as artifacts, exposes stale entries in the Audio Mixer, and removes temporary recovery artifacts after a successful retry or dismiss. Before recovery-backed capture starts, `AudioRecordingService` estimates browser storage headroom, requests persistent storage for long or low-headroom takes when the browser supports it, and surfaces quota/persistence warnings in the toolbar and Audio Mixer.
- Export applies the master target LUFS when set. The gain is computed from the rendered master bus after master effects/fader, capped to +/-24 dB, skipped for effective silence, and applied before the final limiter/peak normalization stage.
- Live playback and export render enabled track sends into the master mix as send-return audio. Dedicated return-bus effect chains are still part of the broader mixer work.
- Compressor, delay, and reverb have browser Web Audio live-routing support; limiter and noise gate have offline/export render support while full live-routing UI for every dynamics parameter is still in progress.
- Region RMS loudness matching exists through the non-destructive repair stack. Full LUFS/true-peak loudness workflows are still in progress.
- Spectral Audio mode has artifact-backed spectrogram display, time/frequency region edit operations, renderable spectral masks, and deterministic image-in-spectrum layers with layer keyframes. Brush editing and full phase-synthesized image resynthesis are still in progress.
- Live audio is limited by browser `playbackRate` behavior and cannot play backwards.
