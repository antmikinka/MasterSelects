# MIDI Tracks — Implementation Plan

> Issue #182 · branch `182-create-midi-tracks`
> Status: **in progress** — Phases 1–4 implemented; Phase 5 (export + persistence) remaining.

## 1. Goal

Add DAW-style MIDI tracks to MasterSelects:

- Right-click an empty area in the timeline's audio section → **Add MIDI Track**.
- A **pencil tool** paints MIDI clip regions onto a MIDI track (like a normal DAW).
- **Double-click** a MIDI clip → opens a **piano-roll editor in a detached browser window** (can live on a second monitor).
- In the piano roll, draw/delete notes freely, normal piano-roll style.
- A **simple synth** (triangle wave + ADSR) makes the MIDI clip audible during playback.

No real MIDI message I/O (no hardware in/out) for now — purely internal.

## 2. Locked-in decisions

These were decided with the user — do not re-litigate:

| Topic | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| **Note timing** | Seconds-based. **Free placement, NO grid snapping.** Normal piano-roll drawing. A better/musical grid comes later, shared with the audio side. |
| **Synth** | Throwaway-simple, just to hear sound: one triangle oscillator + ADSR envelope, polyphonic. Put behind a small instrument abstraction so future real DAW-style instruments slot in without rework. |
| **Piano-roll window** | A **real detached OS window** (`window.open`), reusing the same-origin popup pattern from `src/components/outputManager/OutputManagerBoot.ts`. Because the popup shares the JS heap, it reads the same Zustand stores + audio engine directly. |
| **Playhead cursor** | The piano-roll window subscribes to the same `useTimelineStore.playheadPosition`, so its cursor mirrors the timeline live with no cross-window messaging. |
| **MIDI I/O** | None for now (internal only). |

> Note: the existing `src/types/midi.ts` + `midiStore` are **hardware MIDI control input** (MIDI-learn / parameter bindings). That is unrelated. The track/clip/synth system is a separate subsystem.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Data model

- **Track**: add `'midi'` to `TimelineTrack.type` (currently `'video' | 'audio'`). The instrument lives on the track:
  ```ts
  interface MidiInstrument {
    kind: 'simple-synth';          // extensible: future 'sampler' | 'fm' | ...
    waveform: OscillatorType;      // 'triangle' for now
    adsr: { attack: number; decay: number; sustain: number; release: number };
    gain: number;
  }
  ```
  Stored as e.g. `TimelineTrack.midiInstrument?: MidiInstrument`.
- **Clip**: a MIDI clip is a `TimelineClip` with `source.type = 'midi'` and note data on the clip:
  ```ts
  interface MidiNote {
    id: string;
    pitch: number;     // 0–127
    start: number;     // seconds, relative to clip start
    duration: number;  // seconds
    velocity: number;  // 0–1
  }
  interface MidiClipData { notes: MidiNote[]; }
  ```
  Stored as e.g. `TimelineClip.midiData?: MidiClipData`. Notes on the clip, instrument on the track (DAW convention).
- New types file: `src/types/midiClip.ts` (kept separate from the existing control-input `midi.ts`).

### 3.2 Track type union ripple

Adding `'midi'` to the track-type union touches ~50 spots that reference `'video' | 'audio'`. Strategy:
- Widen the canonical `TimelineTrack.type` and the `addTrack`/`generateTrackId` signatures.
- Treat MIDI tracks like audio tracks for layout (they live in the audio section, similar height) except where MIDI-specific behavior is needed.
- Audit each `type === 'audio'` / `type === 'video'` branch; default MIDI to audio-section behavior unless it must differ. Let `tsc` surface the exhaustive list.

### 3.3 Track creation & UI

- `trackSlice.addTrack('midi')`: create a MIDI track with a default `midiInstrument`, insert in the audio section (bottom), auto-expand.
- `TrackContextMenu.tsx`: add **+ Add MIDI Track** item; widen `trackType` to include `'midi'`.
- Empty-area context menu in the audio section (right-click empty space, right side): add the same **Add MIDI Track** entry.
- MIDI track header/lane styling so it's visually distinct.

### 3.4 Pencil tool (draw MIDI clips)

- Add a `pencil` (a.k.a. `midi-draw`) tool to the tool system: `toolDefaults.ts` (`TIMELINE_TOOL_IDS`, group mapping, mode set), `toolSlice.ts`, and the toolbar/flyout UI.
- Behavior: with the pencil active on a MIDI track, click-drag on empty lane space creates a new empty MIDI clip spanning the dragged time range (free placement, no snap).
- Clicking an existing MIDI clip with the pencil could extend/edit later (out of first scope).

### 3.5 Piano-roll detached window

- New boot module `src/components/pianoRoll/PianoRollBoot.ts`, modeled on `OutputManagerBoot.ts`:
  - `openPianoRoll(clipId)`: `window.open('', 'piano_roll_<clipId>', ...)`, copy app stylesheet, mount a React root rendering `<PianoRoll clipId=... />`.
  - Reconnect-after-refresh + close cleanup, same as the output manager.
- `PianoRoll` component:
  - Vertical axis = pitch (keyboard on the left), horizontal axis = time (seconds) across the clip duration.
  - Draw notes by click-drag (set pitch + start + duration), delete by click/right-click, move/resize notes.
  - Free placement — no snap.
  - **Live playhead cursor**: read `useTimelineStore.playheadPosition`, draw a vertical line at the corresponding time within the clip; only visible while the playhead is over the clip.
  - Edits write back to `clip.midiData` via a timeline store action (with history support).
- Double-click handler on a MIDI clip in `TimelineClip.tsx` → `openPianoRoll(clip.id)`.

### 3.6 Synth + playback

- `src/engine/audio/MidiSynth.ts`: a small WebAudio instrument.
  - `noteOn(pitch, velocity, when)` → `OscillatorNode(waveform)` + `GainNode` shaped by ADSR; `noteOff(pitch, when)` applies release.
  - Polyphonic (track active voices by note id).
  - Reuse `audioManager`'s `AudioContext` for the live transport clock.
- Transport integration: during playback, schedule a clip's notes against the AudioContext timeline as the playhead crosses them (look-ahead scheduler). Stop/flush voices on stop/seek.
- Preview: play a short note when drawing/clicking it in the piano roll.
- **Export**: render MIDI into the offline mix via `AudioMixer` / `AudioExportPipeline` so exports include the synth output. Mirror the live synth's ADSR/oscillator in an `OfflineAudioContext` pass.

### 3.7 Persistence

- Serialize MIDI tracks (`midiInstrument`) and MIDI clips (`midiData.notes`) in the project save/load path (`projectSave.ts` / `projectLoad.ts`, composition/timeline types). MIDI clips have no media file, so they serialize purely as data.

## 4. Phased delivery (checkpoint after each)

1. **Data model + Add MIDI Track** — ✅ done (commit `a2b43e41`).
2. **Pencil tool** — ✅ done (commit `a2b43e41`).
3. **Piano-roll detached window** — ✅ done (commit `a2b43e41`).
4. **Synth + playback** — ✅ implemented. `src/engine/audio/MidiSynth.ts` (triangle/osc + ADSR, polyphonic), `src/services/audio/midiPlaybackScheduler.ts` (look-ahead scheduler subscribed to transport, 1x-forward only, flush on stop/pause/seek), draw/click preview in the piano roll, `audioManager.getContext()/getMixerInput()` accessors. Verify: clips audible during playback.
5. **Export + persistence** — TODO. Offline render path (`AudioMixer`/`AudioExportPipeline`, `OfflineAudioContext`) + serialize `midiInstrument`/`midiData.notes` in projectSave/projectLoad/serializationUtils. Verify: exports contain synth audio; reload keeps tracks/clips/notes.

### Phase 4b — Mixer routing + instrument UI (issue #182, staged)
The synth no longer plays straight to the destination — each MIDI track gets a
**per-track synth bus** so it behaves like a normal mixer channel.

**Step 1 (done):**
- `midiPlaybackScheduler` builds, per MIDI track, `synth → pan → volume → analyser → destination` (+ stereo splitter meter taps). Volume (`getTrackVolumeDb`→linear), pan (`getTrackPan`), and mute/solo (`getTrackAudioMuted/Solo`) read from `track.audioState`; live meters publish via `updateRuntimeAudioMeter(track.id, …)`.
- `AudioMixerPanel` now lists MIDI tracks as channel strips (volume/pan/mute/solo + live meter work end-to-end).
- Properties panel: MIDI tracks show **TRACK Controls** (shared `AudioTrackControlsTab`) + a new **TRACK Instrument** tab (`MidiInstrumentTab`: synth picker, waveform, gain, ADSR) backed by the new `setTrackMidiInstrument` action.
- Piano-roll preview routes through the track bus (respects volume/pan).

**Step 2 (done):** Full mixer parity — EQ + the complete audio-effect stack + sends + master-bus routing for MIDI tracks.
- `audioRoutingManager` now exposes a **generalized node route**: `ensureSharedContext()`, `applyNodeEffects(key, sourceNode, volume, eqGains, pan, processors, master)`, `getNodeMeterSnapshot(key)`, `removeNodeRoute(key)`. The `AudioRoute.sourceNode` type was widened from `MediaElementAudioSourceNode` to `AudioNode`, so a generated source (the synth bus) reuses the **exact same** gain/FX/EQ/pan/meter chain and feeds the shared master bus — no duplicated effect engine.
- `audioGraphRouteSettings.createTrackLiveAudioRouteSettings({ track, masterAudioState })` builds the track + master route settings (volume, EQ gains, FX processors, sends-return gain, pan, mute) for a clip-less source, mirroring `createLiveAudioRouteSettings`.
- `midiPlaybackScheduler` shares the AudioRoutingManager context; each MIDI track's `MidiSynth → sourceGain` is handed to `applyNodeEffects` per tick, and the meter is published from `getNodeMeterSnapshot`. The old self-contained Step 1 bus (pan/volume/analyser/destination) is gone.
- Properties panel: the Effects + Sends tab buttons are now gated on `hasBusControls` (audio **or** MIDI), so MIDI tracks expose the full audio effect palette + sends UI (the content panels were never track-type-gated). MIDI tracks therefore have: Controls + Instrument + Effects + Sends, identical to audio tracks plus the synth instrument tab.

Still TODO: instrument **chip in the MIDI track header** (`TimelineTrack.tsx`) — the Properties Instrument tab covers "which synth is playing" for now.

### Phase 4 implementation notes
- `MidiSynth` is context-agnostic (accepts a `BaseAudioContext`), so the same `scheduleNote` path can later render into an `OfflineAudioContext` for export (Phase 5).
- The scheduler prefers the shared `audioManager` context but falls back to its own `AudioContext` (the master chain is not guaranteed to be `init()`ed), matching the stem-buffer-mixer / composition-mixer pattern.
- Scheduler is initialized once via `ensureMidiPlaybackScheduler()` from `useLayerSync`; it then drives playback purely through a store subscription (no per-frame RAF coupling).

## 6. Open questions / future (explicitly out of scope now)

- Better/musical grid + snapping (shared with audio side) — later.
- Real DAW-style instruments (sampler, FM, multiple voices, effects) — later; the instrument abstraction leaves room.
- Hardware MIDI in/out — later.
- Velocity editing lane, CC automation, quantize — later.
