## Panel System

### Dockable Behavior

All docked panels can be:

- Dragged to rearrange
- Grouped in tabs
- Resized via split panes
- Closed and reopened from the View menu
- Floated as independent windows
- Maximized from the hovered tab with the fullscreen shortcut
- Dropped into the center of a pane with a large anchored preview, or onto the tab bar for exact tab insertion
- Dropped onto the outer dock edges to create full-height side strips or full-width top/bottom strips

### Tab Controls

| Action | Method |
|--------|--------|
| Switch tab | Click |
| Cycle tabs | Middle mouse scroll |
| Drag tab | Hold for 500 ms, then drag |
| Insert into tab group | Drag into the tab group and choose one of the visible gap cubes |
| Maximize hovered tab | Hover a dock tab and use the fullscreen shortcut |

### Floating Panels

- Floating panels keep their own position, size, and z-order
- They can be brought to the front by clicking
- They can be redocked by clicking `Dock` or by dragging the floating panel title tab onto a dock target

### Browser Window Panels

- `Undock to Window` opens a dock tab as a separate browser window
- The detached browser window renders the selected panel through the main editor runtime, so edits and controls affect the main app state
- Detached browser windows keep their last local position and size across refreshes
- The detached browser window can return the panel to the main layout with `Dock back`

---

## Available Panels

MasterSelects currently exposes 18 active dockable panel types, plus the Slot Grid overlay that sits on top of the Timeline. The old `ai-video`, `youtube`, and `download` panel types are treated as deprecated saved-layout migration targets; generation and downloads now live inside the Media Panel.

| Panel | Type ID | Surface |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Multi Preview** | `multi-preview` | 4-slot composition preview grid |
| **Preview** | `preview` | Main composition preview canvas |
| **Timeline** | `timeline` | Multi-track editor and playback surface |
| **Media** | `media` | Media browser, folders, and project items |
| **Properties** | `clip-properties` | Unified clip inspector |
| **History** | `history` | Undo/redo history |
| **Audio Mixer** | `audio-mixer` | Track and master audio controls |
| **Node Workspace** | `node-workspace` | AI-assisted node workspace |
| **Export** | `export` | Render and export controls |
| **MIDI Mapping** | `midi-mapping` | Editable list of assigned MIDI notes and trigger previews |
| **AI Chat** | `ai-chat` | Editing assistant chat |
| **AI Segment** | `ai-segment` | Local SAM2 segmentation tools |
| **AI Scene Description** | `scene-description` | Scene list with playback sync |
| **Multi-Cam** | `multicam` | Multicam sync and EDL tools |
| **Transitions** | `transitions` | Transition library |
| **Waveform** | `scope-waveform` | Waveform scope |
| **Histogram** | `scope-histogram` | Histogram scope |
| **Vectorscope** | `scope-vectorscope` | Vectorscope scope |

### View Menu Grouping

- **Panels** submenu: all dockable panels in one flyout
- Inside **Panels**, entries are grouped into Core, AI, Scopes, and Work in Progress
- Panel entries show their current visible/on state directly in the menu and update immediately when toggled
- **Layouts** submenu: named layouts, default layout selection, and loading saved layouts

### Preview Panel

- Main composition output canvas
- Source selector supports the active composition, a named composition, or a layer-index source
- Per-panel transparency grid toggle
- Multiple preview panels can be opened and floated
- Stats overlay is available

### Multi Preview Panel

- 4-slot grid for showing multiple compositions at once
- Can auto-distribute the active composition's layers or use custom per-slot assignments
- Per-panel transparency grid toggle

### Timeline Panel

- Multi-track video and audio editor
- Composition tabs for switching open compositions
- Playback controls, snapping, and ruler
- Slot Grid overlay is part of the timeline workflow

### Media Panel

- Media browser with folders, compositions, and generated project items
- Single toggle button switches between list view and grid view
- Reorderable column headers in list view
- Grid breadcrumb navigation for folder drilling
- Add menu for compositions, folders, text, 3D text, solids, cameras, splat effectors, mesh primitives, and Gaussian splat import
- Dragging files or folders from the OS recreates the folder structure inside the project
- Dropping multiple OS files directly on the timeline asks whether to place them side by side or stacked on new layers, while still importing through the Media Panel file path first
- Drag-to-timeline support
- Type-specific project items for text, solids, meshes, cameras, and splat effectors
- Board mode right-drag supports smooth edge autopan; dragging far out onto a timeline lane hands off to the same timeline drag preview/drop path as list-view media drags, then restores the item at its original board position
- Bottom-right **Generate** tray expands into the FlashBoard prompt composer for video, image, speech, and music generation without opening a separate dock tab
- Appearance settings include a separate **Wooden media panel theme** checkbox, default off, that switches the Media Panel to the wooden studio skin; disabling it leaves the standard dark panel chrome unchanged

### Export Panel

- Encoder selection: WebCodecs or HTML Video
- WebCodecs and FFmpeg codec choices
- Container, resolution, frame rate, quality, and audio controls
- In/Out export and FCPXML export
- Stacked alpha export
- Progress with phase display

### MIDI Mapping Panel

- Open from `View -> Panels -> MIDI Mapping`
- Shows all currently assigned MIDI notes and control-change bindings in one list
- Includes global transport bindings, per-marker bindings, Slot Grid trigger bindings, and property parameter bindings
- Each row shows the note, target, and resulting command behavior
- Click any transport, marker, or slot mapping card to trigger the assigned action and preview what the MIDI note does
- Mappings flash live while matching MIDI input is currently driving them
- `Edit` opens inline controls for manual channel/note changes and marker reassignment
- Parameter mappings expose inline `Min` / `Max` range inputs, an `Invert` toggle, and a `Damp` checkbox for smoothed value changes
- `Learn` and `Clear` remain available directly from the panel
- Marker bindings support `Jump To Marker`, `Play From Marker`, and `Jump To Marker And Stop`
- Slot bindings can be created from the Slot Grid filled-slot context menu, which opens this panel with a pending `Listening...` mapping

### AI Chat Panel

- GPT-backed editing assistant
- Model and provider selection
- Context-aware editing commands
- First-open onboarding card with example prompts and editor-mode guidance

### AI Segment Panel

- SAM2 object segmentation in the browser
- Point-based include/exclude workflow
- Real-time mask overlay
- Forward propagation for video

### AI Scene Description Panel

- Scene-by-scene video descriptions
- Search within descriptions
- Click-to-seek scene segments
- Playback-synced highlighting

### Media Generator Tray

- Compact bottom-right prompt entry point inside the Media Panel
- Expanded tray embeds only the compact FlashBoard prompt composer for video, image, hosted ElevenLabs audio, hosted Suno music, and non-production BYO audio/music generation
- Active generation jobs render as compact preview cards above the prompt, including queued/processing state, elapsed timer, progress, prompt, and failed-job dismissal
- Service and provider selection reflect the active backend through the FlashBoard composer
- Image, video, and audio media can be attached as ordered prompt references from the Media Panel context menu or by dragging them onto the expanded composer
- Current generation backends are MasterSelects Cloud in production, plus Kie.ai, ElevenLabs, EvoLink, and PiAPI BYO paths for non-production development. Hosted ElevenLabs speech and hosted Suno music use Cloud credits; PiAPI remains primarily as legacy compatibility/catalog metadata rather than the main runtime description for the current generator

#### FlashBoard Prompt Composer

- Composer panel for prompt/text-to-speech/music input, ordered media references, output/model selection, duration, aspect ratio, mode, multi-shot authoring, audio voice settings, and Suno song controls
- Completed generations are imported back into the media store and can be sent to the timeline; ElevenLabs and Suno audio imports under `AI Gen / Audio`
- The tray reuses the FlashBoard queue/import runtime without showing the full node canvas

#### Media Downloads

- Downloads open from the bottom of the Media panel beside Generate and Chat
- Paste one or more URLs from major platforms
- Downloads use the same Media tray queue as generated media
- Completed downloads are imported back into the Media panel under Downloads/platform folders
- The old `youtube` and `download` dock panels are deprecated and removed from restored layouts

### Multi-Cam Panel

- Camera sync and role assignment
- Transcript and EDL-oriented tooling
- Still marked WIP in the View menu

### Transitions Panel

- Draggable transition palette for the current 2D and 3D transition families,
  including dissolve/dip, wipe/iris, push/slide, dedicated 2D rotate,
  stylize, glitch, light, zoom, motion blur, pattern, and 2.5D
  flip/card/roll/spinback variants.
- The palette is grouped into 2D and 3D sections. Related variants appear as a
  single family card; dissolve style, direction, shape, color, motion-blur
  style, light/film style, or pattern variants are selected in the
  transition-scoped Properties tab. The 2D and 3D sections can be collapsed
  when browsing the palette.
- Search filters grouped family cards by family names, transition IDs, variant
  names, descriptions, category aliases, synonym aliases such as film/depth/lens,
  and 2D/3D dimension labels. Glitch search includes hidden RGB split, mosaic,
  pixelate, and scanline variants even though the palette shows one Glitch
  family card. Light search includes Flash, Light Leak, Light Sweep, Projector
  Flicker, Film Roll, and Vignette Bloom variants while the palette keeps them
  grouped as one Light family. Pattern search includes visible multi-panel
  Puzzle Push, Shatter Glass, and Magnetic Tiles variants through the grouped
  Pattern family. 3D search includes separate Flip, Tumble, Roll,
  and Spin families for the current runtime effects; planned dev metadata adds
  non-draggable Cube, Door, Fold, and Peel families.
  Search results stay expanded even if a section was collapsed before searching.
- Family cards show a variant count. Clicking a family expands the draggable
  leaf variants until the pointer leaves the panel; planned dev metadata shows
  a Planned badge and is not draggable.
- Family-card assembly, sectioning, and search indexing live in focused
  transition panel helpers so the panel layout does not grow with each new
  transition definition.
- The transition Properties tab uses the same grouped 2D/3D selector model; its
  choice-button metadata and glyph mapping are kept in focused helpers so the
  Properties tab can grow by family without adding more panel-state code.
- Each transition item carries a plain JSON drag payload with transition ID and duration.
- The duration control keeps only the minimum bound; long transitions are allowed and rely on hold-frame fallback where source material runs out.
- Timeline hover uses source-aware ghosts: normal transition body, real-handle coverage, and red hold-frame fallback coverage.
- The panel is active in the View menu and is no longer marked WIP.

### Video Scopes Panels

Three independent GPU-rendered scopes:

| Panel | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Histogram** | RGB distribution graph with channel modes |
| **Vectorscope** | Color vector analysis |
| **Waveform** | Luma/RGB waveform monitor |

- View mode buttons include RGB, R, G, B, and Luma
- IRE reference remains available
- The scopes are fully GPU-rendered

---

## Slot Grid

Resolume-style slot grid for simultaneous multi-layer composition playback. The grid overlays the Timeline panel and lets each slot run on its own wall-clock time.

### Grid Layout

- 4 rows by 12 columns
- Rows A through D represent playback layers
- Column headers let you activate an entire column
- Slots show a mini timeline preview of the assigned composition

### Opening the Slot Grid

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Toolbar toggle | Switches between the normal timeline and Slot Grid |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Scroll Down` | Zoom out from Timeline into Slot Grid view |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Scroll Up` | Zoom back into Timeline while hovering a filled slot |

### Slot Interaction

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Click a filled slot | Select slot clip settings, open the Slot Clip tab, and either open the comp in the editor or trigger it live depending on `useLiveSlotTrigger` |
| Re-click an active slot | Restart playback from the slot trim-in point |
| Click an empty slot | Deactivate that layer |
| Click a column header | Activate all compositions in that column |
| Drag a slot | Reorder or swap a composition position |
| Right-click a filled slot | Open in Editor, map MIDI to the slot, or Remove from Slot |

### Multi-Layer Playback

- Each layer tracks elapsed time independently
- Active layers loop automatically
- Background layer audio is muted by default
- Deactivating a layer returns control to the next active layer if needed
- Optional warm-deck badges show slot preparation state when `useWarmSlotDecks` is enabled

See [Slot Grid](./Slot-Grid.md) for the current live/deck behavior, slot-clip trimming, and context-menu actions.

## Properties Panel

The unified Properties panel adapts its tabs to the selected clip type, selected audio track/layer, selected master bus, and slot-grid mode. Tab labels are scoped with `CLIP`, `TRACK`, or `MASTER`; transcript tabs are shown only for clip targets.

Selecting a timeline transition switches the panel to `TRANSITION Parameters`.
That tab shows the transition type, first-pass centered placement with timeline
body offset support,
hold-frame policy, duration, planned body range, real source-handle duration,
hold fallback duration, and remove action. The same duration edit operation is
used by the selected timeline body's drag-resize handle; dragging the body
updates the transition offset relative to the cut. Timeline body moves snap to
the centered cut position and source-handle edges; resize handles snap to the
same source-handle edges.

### Standard Video Clip Tabs

| Tab | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| **CLIP Transform** | Position, scale, rotation, opacity, blend mode, and speed |
| **CLIP Effects** | GPU effects list with parameters |
| **CLIP Masks** | Mask shapes with mode and feather controls |
| **CLIP Transcript** | Speech-to-text transcript with playback sync |
| **CLIP Analysis** | Focus, motion, face, and AI scene metadata |

### Audio Clip Tabs

| Tab | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| **CLIP Effects** | Audio effects and linked audio controls |
| **CLIP Audio Edits** | Non-destructive edit-stack operations |
| **CLIP Transcript** | Speech-to-text transcript |

### Audio Track And Master Tabs

| Target | Tabs |
|--------|------|
| **Audio track/layer** | TRACK Controls, TRACK Effects, TRACK Sends |
| **Master bus** | MASTER Controls, MASTER Effects |

### Text and 3D Text Tabs

| Clip Type | Tabs |
|-----------|------|
| **Text** | Text, Transform, Effects, Masks |
| **3D Text** | 3D Text, Transform, Effects, Masks |

### Specialized Clip Tabs

| Clip Type | Tabs |
|-----------|------|
| **Vector Animation** | Lottie/Rive, Transform, Effects, Masks |
| **Gaussian avatar** | Blendshapes, Transform, Effects, Masks |
| **Gaussian splat** | Transform, Gaussian Splat, Effects, Masks |
| **Camera** | Transform |
| **Splat effector** | Transform, Effector |
| **Slot Grid clip** | Slot Clip |

### Camera Transform Controls

- Camera clips expose `Nav Mode` controls at the top of the Transform tab.
- Camera lens and gate controls also live in the Transform tab: FOV, full-frame-equivalent millimeters, Near, Far, and Resolution X/Y.
- The legacy camera Zoom and Distance controls are hidden from the Camera Transform UI to avoid mixing a real-camera surface with orbit-rig controls.
- In Scene Nav, mouse wheel over the preview moves the real camera position along the current view direction, so X/Y/Z can all change. It does not change FOV or the mm lens field.
- Camera Position X/Y/Z is the camera eye position in world space and is edited independently from lens FOV/mm; changing the lens does not rewrite or recalculate the position fields.
- Camera Resolution X/Y sets the edit-view gate aspect used to draw the camera frame; it is stored with the camera clip and has keyframe controls like the other camera settings.
- Camera Edit mode uses its own 35 mm free-camera lens by default, independent of the timeline camera clip's lens or keyframes.
- `FPS` switches preview navigation between orbit-style look and FPS-style look.
- `NO KF` keeps existing camera keyframes active during playback, but routes preview navigation and MIDI camera-look input into temporary live offsets instead of writing new camera keyframes.
- Live `NO KF` offsets are added on top of the keyframed camera pose for preview control and are cleared when `NO KF` is turned off.
- Live `NO KF` offsets are not saved to the project and are ignored for export renders, so the stored camera animation remains the source of truth.

### Solid Clip Behavior

- Solid clips show a color picker bar above the tabs
- The picker updates the clip color in place

### Tab Behavior

- Tabs switch automatically based on clip type
- Clicking an audio track/layer in the Timeline or a strip in the Audio Mixer selects the same `TRACK` Properties target, highlights both surfaces, and smoothly reveals off-screen timeline audio layers
- Clicking the master bus selects the `MASTER` Properties target
- Badge counts appear for effects, masks, transcripts, and analysis readiness
- Slot grid mode switches the panel to the Slot Clip tab
- The Slot Clip tab shows the slotted composition tracks, the configured trim window, and the current live layer playhead on one range timeline

## Dock Layouts

### Built-In Layouts

The built-in `VIDEO EDIT` layout is the default desktop layout:

- Left column: Media
- Center: Preview
- Right column: Properties, Export, History (Export active)
- Bottom: Timeline

Its timeline defaults to balanced video/audio focus with two visible 70 px video tracks and one visible 48 px compact audio track, so audio headers keep the bottom pan rail visible without showing the inline volume fader.
On a first empty load, `VIDEO EDIT` is also the active named layout, so the header switcher and Layouts menu show it as current.

The built-in `AUDIO EDIT` layout keeps Timeline above Media, Audio Mixer, and Properties/History. Its timeline defaults to audio focus with two visible 40 px video context tracks and one visible 96 px full-height audio track.

Multi Preview, scopes, and other panels are available from the View menu and can be floated or docked.

### Layout Persistence

- The dock layout is persisted with Zustand and project state
- Floating panels are restored across sessions
- Browser window panels are restored from local dock state on refresh and stay connected when project layout hydration runs
- Invalid panel types are cleaned up on load
- Named layouts can be stored in the View menu and reused later
- The active named layout can be overwritten directly with `Save to Current Layout`
- Named layouts also store the timeline audio focus/display mode, track slot counts, per-slot heights, and track visibility
- Loading a saved layout animates panel movement, resizing, and reflow over 500ms
- A saved layout can be marked as the default layout
- Loading a layout creates missing tracks for saved slots without deleting extra existing tracks

### Tab Context Menu

Right-clicking a dock tab opens a tab menu. `Undock` moves that tab into a freely movable and
resizable floating panel, `Undock to Window` opens it in a separate browser window with a `Dock back`
control, `Hide` removes that tab, and `Change to` replaces the tab slot with another panel. If the
target panel is already open elsewhere, it is moved into the clicked slot instead of creating a
duplicate. The Timeline panel uses composition tabs instead of a normal panel tab; right-click the
empty part of its tab bar next to the composition tabs to open the Timeline panel menu.

### Layout Actions

| Action | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Save Current Layout | View -> Layouts |
| Save to Current Layout | View -> Layouts |
| Load Saved Layout | View -> Layouts |
| Set Current as Default | View -> Layouts |
| Set Saved Layout as Default | View -> Layouts |
| Load Default Layout | View -> Layouts |

## MIDI Control

### Enabling MIDI

Edit menu -> Settings -> MIDI

### Requirements

- Browser Web MIDI API support
- MIDI device connected
- Permission granted

### Status Display

```
MIDI Control (N devices)
```

### Mapping Overview

- `View -> Panels -> MIDI Mapping` opens the dedicated mapping panel
- The panel lists all assigned transport, marker, slot, and parameter bindings
- Clicking a binding previews the exact trigger path without needing a physical MIDI note
- Matching mappings flash in the panel when the hardware input is used
- Parameter bindings can be range-adjusted, inverted, and damped directly in the mapping panel
- Empty-state guidance points back to Settings and the marker right-click menu
- Right-click a numeric parameter name in the Properties panel to open its MIDI menu and learn or clear a MIDI note/CC binding. Right-clicking the numeric value itself still resets the value to its default. Learned CC values map across the parameter's configured range and then use the same edit path as manual changes.

---

## Resolution Settings

### Output Resolution

Configured in Settings -> Output.

| Preset | Dimensions |
|--------|------------|
| 1080p | 1920 x 1080 |
| 1440p | 2560 x 1440 |
| 4K | 3840 x 2160 |
| 9:16 | 1080 x 1920 |

Custom width and height are also supported. This applies to newly created compositions; the active composition can still be configured per item in the Media panel.

### Preview Quality

Configured in Settings -> Previews.

| Option | Render Size |
|--------|-------------|
| Full | 100% |
| Half | 50% |
| Quarter | 25% |

Lower preview quality reduces GPU workload and memory use on engine-backed preview targets. It does not change export resolution or the HTML-only source monitor.

## Settings Dialog

### Opening

Edit menu -> Settings

### Categories

| Category | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| **General** | Save mode, autosave interval/enable state, import copy behavior, timeline zoom anchor, shortcut/mouse input display, output defaults, preview quality, GPU preference, AI feature settings, and mobile/desktop view mode |
| **MIDI** | Browser MIDI permission state, transport learning, and device list |
| **Shortcuts** | Preset selection, overrides, recorder, reset, and custom preset controls |
| **Appearance** | Theme selection, custom theme controls, interface text scale, interface font, high-readability colors, and studio surface skins |
| **Audio** | Browser input/output device selection, latency mode, device API status, output-routing status, and AudioContext diagnostics |
| **Transcription** | Provider selection and pricing |
| **Native Helper** | Native helper connection, port, helper-backed flows, and decode settings |
| **API Keys** | OpenAI, AssemblyAI, Deepgram, Kie.ai, PiAPI (legacy/compat), ElevenLabs, and YouTube |

The Preferences dialog drag position is updated at animation-frame cadence during mouse movement so moving the dialog does not force React state updates for every raw mouse event.

### API Keys

The current Media generator-relevant keys are:

- `Kie.ai` for non-production local-provider FlashBoard generation flows
- `Kie.ai` also powers hosted FlashBoard Suno music through the Cloudflare `KIEAI_API_KEY` secret in production
- `ElevenLabs` for non-production BYO text-to-speech; production hosted speech uses the Cloudflare `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` secret
- `PiAPI` for legacy compatibility and older catalog/pricing paths

Hosted cloud access is account/session based and does not depend on a user-entered API key in this dialog.
