# Complete Refactor Checklist

Status: execution plan
Updated: 2026-06-09

This checklist tracks the actual codebase refactor plan in
`docs/ongoing/Complete-refactor.md`.

Handoff files are prepared as execution templates. Use them when the master
orchestrator or worker-agent execution run starts.

## Progress Snapshot

- Complete Refactor execution plan: active
- Baseline: static scan counts refreshed from current worktree; runtime smoke
  baselines remain open
- Working docs: keep to plan + checklist unless data becomes too large
- Handoff templates: prepared for execution only
- Source implementation: current bounded source packet has explicit write set,
  forbidden files, and gates
- Current bounded packet: none; wave 4 (packets 159-163 plus orchestrator
  ratchet) completed and verified; type-barrel goal criterion met; next wave =
  P1A webCodecsHelpers lease migration, next MediaPanel slice, then
  P2-GETSTATE-ADAPTER-FREEZE formalization.
- Completed source/tooling packet: `P0-REG-001`; focused registry checks passed.
- Completed bounded packet: `P0-BASELINE-REFRESH-001`, read-only plus docs.
- Completed bounded packet: `P1-CONTRACT-001`, contracts and focused boundary
  test only.
- Completed bounded packet: `P1A-RUNTIME-LEASE-001`, media runtime lease
  contracts, persisted-state guard, HMR singleton hardening, and focused tests.
- Completed bounded packet: `P1B-SIGNAL-DTO-001`, signal DTO runtime-free
  guard, universal format matrix, unknown-file fallback contract, and focused
  tests.
- Advanced bounded packet: `P1-P3-SCHEMA-FREEZE-001`; project schema no longer
  imports stores/components/engine/runtime services or the broad `src/types`
  barrel. P1 schema import gates are satisfied; P2/P3 integration remains open.
- Completed bounded packet: `P3-HYDRATION-ADAPTER-001`; sequence-frame
  `File`/object-URL fields are removed from persisted project DTOs and
  `projectLoad.ts` owns runtime hydration from project raw paths or handles.
- Completed bounded packet: `P3-DEPRECATED-PAYLOADS-001`; obsolete
  `ProjectFile.youtube` payloads are removed from current project schema and
  YouTube store changes no longer mark projects dirty.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-P3-UI-LAYOUT-PREFLIGHT-001`; dock deprecated
  panel cleanup and retired FlashBoard board/canvas cleanup now have executable
  gates, high-conflict ownership, and retired-path ledger entries.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-P3-UI-LAYOUT-CLEANUP-001`; retired dock
  `youtube`/`download`/`ai-video` ids are removed from the active dock contract,
  old restored-layout payloads are dropped, active downloads remain in the
  Media Panel tray, and FlashBoard store state is classified into active
  composer/reference-hover versus retired board workspace fields.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-SHELL-PREFLIGHT-001`; Media Panel
  shell/grid/import/context split targets, FlashBoard composer module targets,
  focused smoke checks, and the retired FlashBoard board/canvas usage scan are
  recorded.
- Completed first source slice: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-SHELL-SPLIT-001`; extracted
  Media Panel search, view-mode controls, shared Add item menu, context-menu
  shape, and grid duration formatting. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced from 5,544
  to 5,369 LOC; shell split remains open.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-GRID-CONTEXT-SPLIT-002`;
  extracted grid item rendering, grid breadcrumb rendering, and context-menu
  frame positioning. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced from 5,369 to 5,298 LOC;
  shell split remains open.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-LIST-PRESENTATION-SPLIT-003`;
  extracted classic list row shell, folder indentation chrome, rename input,
  status badges, and metadata cell presentation. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced
  from 5,298 to 4,978 LOC; shell split remains open.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-CONTEXT-ACTIONS-SPLIT-004`;
  extracted non-board context action sections, move-folder submenu,
  regenerate-artifact submenu, explorer submenu, and selected-item action
  presentation. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced from 4,978 to 4,809 LOC; shell
  split remains open.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-ANNOTATION-CONTEXT-SPLIT-005`;
  extracted board annotation color context presentation. `MediaPanel.tsx` is
  reduced from 4,809 to 4,785 LOC; shell split remains open.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-DROP-EMPTY-STATES-SPLIT-006`;
  extracted external drop overlay, no-media empty state, and search-empty
  presentation. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced from 4,785 to 4,769 LOC; shell
  split remains open.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-HEADER-ACTIONS-SPLIT-007`;
  extracted header count, relink prompt, import button, view controls, and Add
  dropdown shell. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced from 4,769 to 4,738 LOC; shell
  split remains open.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-CLASSIC-LIST-CHROME-SPLIT-008`;
  extracted classic list wrapper, column headers, virtual spacers, and marquee
  overlay presentation. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced from 4,738 to 4,669 LOC;
  shell split remains open.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-GRID-CHROME-SPLIT-009`;
  extracted grid wrapper, breadcrumb placement, grid container, and grid
  marquee overlay presentation. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced from 4,669 to
  4,645 LOC; shell split remains open.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-FEEDBACK-TRAY-SHELL-SPLIT-010`;
  extracted floating feedback portal and generation-tray mount shell.
  `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced from 4,645 to 4,636 LOC; shell split remains
  open.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-SELECTOR-PREFLIGHT-011`;
  read-only source inspection classified the next safe source slice as board
  extraction, not selector or folder/import-status extraction. No source files
  changed in this packet.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-VIEW-HOST-SPLIT-012`;
  extracted the typed `MediaBoardHost` prop boundary and exported
  `MediaBoardViewProps`; Media Board renderer, layout, storage, overview
  canvas, gesture, store, and project behavior stayed unchanged. Current
  worktree count is 5,166 LOC; shell split remains open.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-DATA-SPLIT-013`;
  extracted Media Board annotation types, constants, storage key, load/save,
  and normalization helpers into `media/board/annotations.ts`. `MediaPanel.tsx`
  is reduced from 5,166 to 5,077 LOC in the current worktree; annotation UI,
  drag/resize math, context-menu wiring, and renderer markup stayed unchanged.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-LAYER-SPLIT-014`;
  extracted Media Board annotation layer JSX/presentation event attachment into
  `media/board/MediaBoardAnnotationLayer.tsx`. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced
  from 5,077 to 5,006 LOC in the current worktree; annotation data helpers,
  drag/resize math, context-menu presentation, and renderer behavior stayed
  unchanged.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-CONTROLLER-PREFLIGHT-015`;
  read-only scans show annotation state/save/update can move first, while
  visible filtering, drag/resize math, edit-focus, and context-menu selection
  should stay in `MediaPanel.tsx` until a later controller packet.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-STATE-SPLIT-016`;
  extracted Media Board annotation state, selected annotation state, save
  effect, reload, and update normalization into
  `media/board/useMediaBoardAnnotationState.ts`. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced
  from 5,006 to 4,975 LOC in the current worktree; annotation creation,
  visible filtering, drag/resize math, edit-focus, context-menu selection,
  layer presentation, and renderer behavior stayed unchanged.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-CREATE-SPLIT-017`;
  moved Media Board annotation creation, append, and selection command into
  `useMediaBoardAnnotationState.ts`. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced from 4,975 to
  4,954 LOC in the current worktree; context-menu point ownership, visible
  filtering, drag/resize math, edit-focus, context-menu selection UI, layer
  presentation, and renderer behavior stayed unchanged.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-VISIBILITY-SPLIT-018`;
  extracted Media Board annotation visible-rect filtering into
  `media/board/annotations.ts` as a pure helper. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced
  from 4,954 to 4,951 LOC in the current worktree; drag/resize math,
  edit-focus, context-menu selection UI, layer presentation, board renderer,
  media store, project, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime
  stayed untouched.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-GESTURE-PREFLIGHT-019`;
  read-only scans show annotation resize geometry is the next safe source
  slice; drag still owns body cursor/user-select side effects and context-menu
  suppression, while focus owns a DOM lookup through `boardCanvasRef`.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-RESIZE-MATH-SPLIT-020`;
  extracted pure Media Board annotation resize geometry into
  `media/board/annotations.ts`. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced from 4,951 to
  4,933 LOC in the current worktree; listener lifetime, viewport zoom delta
  conversion, drag behavior, body style side effects, context-menu suppression,
  focus, layer presentation, board renderer, media store, project, Timeline,
  render, export, preview, and media runtime stayed untouched.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-FOCUS-HELPER-SPLIT-021`;
  extracted the Media Board annotation text-focus DOM lookup into
  `media/board/annotationDom.ts`. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced from 4,933 to
  4,932 LOC in the current worktree; requestAnimationFrame timing,
  drag/resize behavior, context-menu behavior, layer presentation, renderer,
  media store, project, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime
  stayed untouched.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-DRAG-MATH-SPLIT-022`;
  extracted pure Media Board annotation drag-position calculation into
  `media/board/annotations.ts`. `MediaPanel.tsx` remains 4,932 LOC in the
  current worktree; drag distance gating, listener lifetime, body style side
  effects, context-menu suppression, focus, layer presentation, renderer,
  media store, project, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime
  stayed untouched.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-CONTROLLER-PREFLIGHT-023`;
  read-only scans show the remaining annotation drag/resize controller can move
  as a focused hook if it receives selection, close-context, suppression,
  viewport, and update callbacks as dependencies; MediaBoardView, renderer,
  media store, project, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime
  stay out of scope.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-GESTURE-HOOK-SPLIT-024`;
  extracted Media Board annotation drag/resize controller callbacks into
  `media/board/useMediaBoardAnnotationGestures.ts`. `MediaPanel.tsx` is
  reduced from 4,932 to 4,844 LOC in the current worktree; context-menu
  selection, edit-toggle, focus, layer presentation, renderer, media store,
  project, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime stayed
  untouched.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-COMMAND-HOOK-SPLIT-025`;
  extracted Media Board annotation context-menu selection, focus, edit-toggle,
  and text-focus request callbacks into
  `media/board/useMediaBoardAnnotationCommands.ts`. `MediaPanel.tsx` is
  reduced from 4,844 to 4,830 LOC in the current worktree; gesture behavior,
  layer presentation, renderer, media store, project, Timeline, render, export,
  preview, and media runtime stayed untouched.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-BOARD-ANNOTATION-CONTEXT-MENU-SPLIT-026`;
  extracted Media Board annotation context-menu lookup and frame/menu mount into
  `media/context/MediaAnnotationContextMenuMount.tsx`. `MediaPanel.tsx` is
  reduced from 4,830 to 4,824 LOC in the current worktree; annotation color
  update behavior, non-annotation context actions, gestures, layer
  presentation, renderer, media store, project, Timeline, render, export,
  preview, and media runtime stayed untouched.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-CONTEXT-ACTIONS-MOUNT-PREFLIGHT-027`;
  classified the normal Media context-actions mount and confirmed the next safe
  source slice is a pure derived-state planner, not another frame wrapper or
  handler grouping. Source stayed untouched; media store selectors/actions,
  FlashBoard, Media Board renderer/layout/storage/constants/types, project,
  Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime stayed untouched.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-CONTEXT-ACTIONS-DERIVED-PROPS-SPLIT-028`;
  extracted normal Media context-actions derived props into
  `media/context/contextActionState.ts`. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced from 4,824
  to 4,788 LOC in the current worktree; context action presentation, async
  explorer/download fallback, proxy-folder handler, media store
  selectors/actions, FlashBoard, project, Timeline, render, export, preview,
  and media runtime stayed untouched. Checks passed: `npx tsc -b --pretty
  false`; `npm run test -- tests/unit/mediaPanelDropImport.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelItemTypeGuards.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelSourceMonitor.test.tsx`; FlashBoard boundary scan showed
  only existing composer reference ownership. A read-only Claude reviewer found
  no behavioral regression or boundary violation.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-CONTEXT-SELECTED-ITEM-STATE-SPLIT-029`;
  extracted normal context-menu selected-item lookup and media/composition/solid
  role classification into `media/context/contextSelectedItemState.ts`.
  `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced from 4,788 to 4,779 LOC in the current worktree;
  selected-item lookup order, context action presentation, async
  explorer/download fallback, proxy-folder handler, media store
  selectors/actions, FlashBoard, project, Timeline, render, export, preview,
  and media runtime stayed untouched. Checks passed: `npx tsc -b --pretty
  false`; `npm run test -- tests/unit/mediaPanelDropImport.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelItemTypeGuards.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelSourceMonitor.test.tsx`; FlashBoard boundary scan showed
  only existing composer reference ownership.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-CONTEXT-HANDLER-OWNERSHIP-PREFLIGHT-030`;
  classified the remaining inline normal context action handlers and selected a
  small explorer/proxy-folder handler hook as the next safe source slice. Source
  stayed untouched; context action presentation, solid settings, move-to-folder,
  media store selectors/actions, FlashBoard, project, Timeline, render, export,
  preview, and media runtime stayed untouched.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-CONTEXT-EXPLORER-HANDLERS-SPLIT-031`;
  extracted raw source explorer, proxy explorer, and pick-proxy-folder callbacks
  into `media/context/useMediaContextExplorerHandlers.ts`. `MediaPanel.tsx` is
  reduced from 4,779 to 4,764 LOC in the current worktree; raw fallback download
  behavior, close timing, solid settings, move-to-folder, context action
  presentation, media store selectors/actions, FlashBoard, project, Timeline,
  render, export, preview, and media runtime stayed untouched. Checks passed:
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false`; `npm run test --
  tests/unit/mediaPanelDropImport.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelItemTypeGuards.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelSourceMonitor.test.tsx`; FlashBoard boundary scan showed
  only existing composer reference ownership.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-CONTEXT-LOCAL-HANDLERS-SPLIT-032`;
  extracted the move-to-folder adapter and solid-settings callback into
  `media/context/useMediaContextLocalHandlers.ts`. `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced
  from 4,764 to 4,758 LOC in the current worktree; move-to-folder selection
  semantics, solid-settings dialog payload, close timing, async explorer
  handlers, AI reference, rename, create, duplicate, delete, context action
  presentation, media store selectors/actions, FlashBoard, project, Timeline,
  render, export, preview, and media runtime stayed untouched. Checks passed:
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false`; `npm run test --
  tests/unit/mediaPanelDropImport.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelItemTypeGuards.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelSourceMonitor.test.tsx`; FlashBoard boundary scan showed
  only existing composer reference ownership.
- Accepted interim warning: Media Board source boundaries are still uneven.
  Current worktree counts are `MediaBoardView.tsx` 734 LOC, `layout.ts` 817
  LOC, and `MediaBoardHost.tsx` 7 LOC. This is not a blocker for completed
  context-menu slices; treat it as a later Board/View/Layout boundary packet,
  not as a reason to undo the current split.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-BOARD-VIEW-LAYOUT-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-033`;
  classified the accepted Media Board source-size warning. The next safe source
  packet is a pure `layout.ts` reconciliation split, not a JSX view split or
  host removal. Source stayed untouched; `MediaBoardView.tsx` remains a later
  view/node boundary candidate, `MediaBoardHost.tsx` remains an accepted thin
  pass-through for now, and media store selectors/actions, FlashBoard, project,
  Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime stayed untouched.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-BOARD-LAYOUT-RECONCILE-SPLIT-034`;
  extracted `reconcileMediaBoardLayouts` into
  `media/board/layoutReconcile.ts`. `layout.ts` is reduced from 817 to 641 LOC
  in the current worktree, and `layoutReconcile.ts` is 188 LOC; layout
  reconciliation behavior, caller semantics, layout geometry, storage,
  constants, overview canvas, type contracts, `MediaBoardView.tsx`,
  `MediaBoardHost.tsx`, media store selectors/actions, FlashBoard, project,
  Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime stayed unchanged. Checks
  passed: `npx tsc -b --pretty false`; `npm run test --
  tests/unit/mediaPanelDropImport.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelItemTypeGuards.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelSourceMonitor.test.tsx`; boundary scan shows
  `reconcileMediaBoardLayouts` imported from `layoutReconcile.ts`.
- Remaining accepted interim warning: `MediaBoardView.tsx` is still 734 LOC and
  `MediaBoardHost.tsx` is still a 7 LOC pass-through. Treat that as a later
  Board View/Node boundary packet; do not undo the completed context or layout
  splits.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-BOARD-VIEW-NODE-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-035`;
  classified the remaining `MediaBoardView.tsx` boundary and confirmed the next
  safe source packet is a node renderer split. `MediaBoardNode` and its
  video-scrub/poster helpers are a self-contained renderer responsibility;
  Board shell, groups, insert gaps, `children`, marquee rendering, host
  pass-through, layout, storage, constants, overview canvas, type contracts,
  media store selectors/actions, FlashBoard, project, Timeline, render, export,
  preview, and media runtime stay out of that source packet.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-BOARD-NODE-RENDERER-SPLIT-036`;
  extracted `MediaBoardNode` and its video preview helpers into
  `media/board/MediaBoardNode.tsx`. `MediaBoardView.tsx` is reduced from 734 to
  315 LOC in the current worktree, and `MediaBoardNode.tsx` is 429 LOC; node
  JSX semantics, video-preview behavior, thumbnail request timing, refresh
  fallback behavior, focused-original overlay math, selection classes,
  context-menu suppression, Board shell, groups, insert gaps, `children`,
  marquee, host pass-through, layout, storage, constants, overview canvas,
  MediaPanel behavior, type contracts, media store selectors/actions,
  FlashBoard, project, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime
  stayed unchanged. Checks passed: `npx tsc -b --pretty false`; `npm run test
  -- tests/unit/mediaPanelDropImport.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelItemTypeGuards.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelSourceMonitor.test.tsx`; boundary scan shows the node
  renderer and video helpers only in `MediaBoardNode.tsx`.
- Remaining accepted interim warning: `MediaBoardHost.tsx` is still a 7 LOC
  pass-through. Treat it as a host-boundary preflight/deletion candidate, not a
  drive-by deletion.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-BOARD-HOST-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-037`;
  classified `MediaBoardHost.tsx` as a delete-now candidate. It is imported only
  by `MediaPanel.tsx`, aliases `MediaBoardViewProps`, and renders
  `<MediaBoardView {...props} />` without owning runtime state, board shell
  behavior, event handling, or a durable boundary. Source stayed untouched in
  the preflight.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-MEDIA-BOARD-HOST-PASSTHROUGH-DELETE-038`;
  deleted `media/board/MediaBoardHost.tsx` and switched `MediaPanel.tsx` to
  import/render `MediaBoardView` directly. `MediaBoardView.tsx` remains 315 LOC,
  `MediaBoardNode.tsx` 429 LOC, `layout.ts` 641 LOC, and `layoutReconcile.ts`
  188 LOC in the current worktree; `MediaBoardViewProps`, Board shell, node
  renderer, layout, storage, constants, overview canvas, MediaPanel behavior,
  board contracts, media store selectors/actions, FlashBoard, project,
  Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime stayed unchanged. Checks
  passed: `npx tsc -b --pretty false`; `npm run test --
  tests/unit/mediaPanelDropImport.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelItemTypeGuards.test.ts
  tests/unit/mediaPanelSourceMonitor.test.tsx`; boundary scan shows no
  `MediaBoardHost` source reference remains.
- Resolved interim Media Board source warning: `MediaBoardView.tsx`,
  `MediaBoardNode.tsx`, `layout.ts`, and `layoutReconcile.ts` are all below the
  product-source ceiling, and the no-value host pass-through is deleted.
- Completed bounded packet: `P4-FLASHBOARD-RETIRED-BOARD-USAGE-PREFLIGHT-039`;
  re-scanned retired FlashBoard board/canvas CSS, store fields, selectors,
  runtime, Composer, and services before deletion. `npm run test --
  tests/unit/flashboardRetiredBoardClassification.test.ts` passed. The scan
  confirms direct deletion is not yet safe: retired board workspace fields
  (`activeBoardId`, `boards`, `selectedNodeIds`, `viewMode`) are still used by
  `FlashBoardComposer`, `useFlashBoardRuntime`, store selectors/slices, and
  `FlashBoardMediaBridge` for active draft/job/import behavior. Source stayed
  untouched.
- Project compatibility policy: current schema only; old saved projects may
  break; deprecated payloads are delete-or-ignore candidates.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-RETIRED-STORE-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-040`; re-scanned
  active generation job/import dependencies. `npm run test --
  tests/unit/flashboardRetiredBoardClassification.test.ts` passed. Active
  Composer/runtime/job/import still uses FlashBoard nodes as draft/job/result
  records, and `FlashBoardMediaBridge` reads board nodes to build generated
  media metadata and complete imports.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-RECORD-ADAPTER-SPLIT-041`; added
  `src/stores/flashboardStore/activeGenerationRecords.ts` and updated
  `FlashBoardMediaBridge` to use it for request lookup and completion instead
  of directly importing `useFlashBoardStore`/`FlashBoardNode`. Focused tests and
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false` passed.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-MEDIA-AI-GENERATION-QUEUE-RECORD-ADAPTER-SPLIT-042`; extended the active
  generation record adapter with queue list/dismiss access and updated
  `MediaAIGenerationQueue.tsx` to stop directly reading `boards`,
  `FlashBoardNode`, or `removeNode`. Focused tests and
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false` passed.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-COMPOSER-SUBMIT-ADAPTER-SPLIT-043`; extended the active
  generation record adapter with board availability and request submission, and
  updated `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` to stop importing `selectActiveBoard` and
  direct draft/request/queue node actions. Focused tests and
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false` passed.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-RUNTIME-UPDATE-ADAPTER-SPLIT-044`; extended the active
  generation record adapter with runtime board bootstrap, job update/fail, and
  selection/delete access, and updated `useFlashBoardRuntime.ts` to stop
  importing FlashBoard store internals or `selectActiveBoard`. Focused tests and
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false` passed.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P3-P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-PERSISTENCE-PREFLIGHT-045`; re-scanned
  FlashBoard project save/load/lifecycle persistence. `npm run test --
  tests/unit/projectSchemaBoundary.test.ts
  tests/unit/flashboardActiveGenerationRecords.test.ts` passed. Remaining
  retired board/node coupling is concentrated in `ProjectFlashBoardState`,
  `projectSave.ts`, `projectLoad.ts`, `projectLifecycle.ts`, store types, and
  backing store internals; active UI/service paths already use the active
  generation record adapter.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P3-P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-PERSISTENCE-SCHEMA-SPLIT-046`; current
  project persistence now saves/loads active FlashBoard `generationRecords` and
  generation metadata instead of retired board/node payloads. Project load
  hydrates records through the active generation adapter, lifecycle/autosave no
  longer subscribe to retired board payloads, old saved project migration was
  not added, and focused tests plus `npx tsc -b --pretty false` passed.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-RETIRED-BOARD-CSS-DELETE-047`; deleted the unused retired
  `.flashboard-*` workspace/toolbar/canvas/node/context CSS block from
  `FlashBoard.css` while preserving active `.fb-*` Composer and Media AI
  queue/tray styles. Retired class usage scan is clean, active style scan still
  finds the expected classes, focused tests passed, and `npx tsc -b --pretty
  false` passed.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-STORE-INTERNALS-PREFLIGHT-048`; read-only
  scans and focused tests classify the remaining retired FlashBoard
  `activeBoardId`/`boards`/`selectedNodeIds`, board/node selectors, and
  board/node slice actions as local store/test backing-model debt. The next
  source packet can stay inside `flashboardStore` plus FlashBoard unit tests;
  project schema, MediaStore, Timeline, render, export, preview, Media Board,
  and media runtime stay out of scope.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-STORE-MODEL-SPLIT-049`; replaced the local
  FlashBoard backing board/node store model with first-class
  `activeGenerationRecords`, deleted the old board/node slices, updated
  reference-usage selectors and FlashBoard unit tests, and moved global history
  FlashBoard snapshots/restores to active generation records. Focused
  FlashBoard tests, `tests/stores/historyStore.test.ts`, old board-field
  scans, and `npx tsc -b --pretty false` passed.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-NAMING-PREFLIGHT-050`; read-only scans
  classify remaining `nodeId` names as local FlashBoard job-service,
  runtime-callback, and media-bridge identifiers for active generation records.
  `draftNodeId`/`openComposer`/`closeComposer` are now local Composer-state
  naming debt. The rename can stay inside FlashBoard service/runtime/store
  files and FlashBoard unit tests; project schema, MediaStore, Timeline,
  render, export, preview, Media Board, and media runtime stay out of scope.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-RECORD-ID-RENAME-051`; renamed local
  FlashBoard job-service/runtime/media-bridge identifiers from `nodeId` to
  `recordId`, removed the unused Composer `draftNodeId`/`openComposer`/
  `closeComposer` state remnant, and updated FlashBoard unit fixtures. Rename
  scans, old board-field scans, focused FlashBoard tests, and `npx tsc -b
  --pretty false` passed.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-SERVICE-SIZE-PREFLIGHT-052`; read-only
  classification shows the remaining P4 pressure is active size/coupling:
  `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is 3895 LOC, `FlashBoard.css` is 2469 LOC, and
  `FlashBoardJobService.ts` is 715 LOC. The smallest safe next split is an
  active CSS section split that preserves class names and import order without
  changing Composer, job-service, project, MediaStore, Timeline, render,
  export, preview, Media Board, or media runtime source.
- Phase details: split under `docs/ongoing/complete-refactor/`; the root
  `Complete-refactor.md` is now the orchestrator index.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CSS-SECTION-SPLIT-053` to split active
  `FlashBoard.css` into role-specific CSS section files while preserving active
  `.fb-*` and Media AI tray behavior.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CSS-SECTION-SPLIT-053`; split active `FlashBoard.css`
  into an ordered import manifest plus `FlashBoardBubble.css`,
  `FlashBoardReferences.css`, `FlashBoardMultishot.css`,
  `FlashBoardControls.css`, and `FlashBoardPopovers.css`. Class names and
  cascade order are preserved, `MediaAIGenerativeTray.css` stayed read-only,
  the retired `.flashboard-*` board-class scan remained clean, active `.fb-*`
  selector scans passed, and focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-JOB-SOURCE-PREFLIGHT-054` to classify the next
  TS source split after the CSS split: Composer UI/controller boundary versus
  job-service provider runner boundary.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-JOB-SOURCE-PREFLIGHT-054`; read-only scans
  show `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` remains a 3895 LOC UI/controller hub, while
  `FlashBoardJobService.ts` is a 715 LOC provider-dispatch hub with one long
  `startJob` path for Suno, ElevenLabs/audio, image, and video runners. Focused
  FlashBoard tests passed. The next TS split should target the job-service
  provider runner boundary first because it has a narrower runtime contract and
  direct unit coverage, while the Composer split needs a later UI/controller
  packet.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-JOB-PROVIDER-RUNNER-SPLIT-055` to move provider runner
  execution out of `FlashBoardJobService.ts` while keeping queue/cancel/retry
  ownership in the service.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-JOB-PROVIDER-RUNNER-SPLIT-055`; moved provider task
  execution into `FlashBoardProviderRunners.ts` while keeping queue, cancel,
  retry, concurrency, running cleanup, and update orchestration in
  `FlashBoardJobService.ts`. `FlashBoardJobService.ts` is now 373 LOC and the
  role-specific runner module is 420 LOC. Focused FlashBoard tests and
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-056` to classify the next
  Composer TSX source split by UI/controller ownership before editing
  `FlashBoardComposer.tsx`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-056`; read-only
  classification confirms `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is still 3895 LOC and its
  major clusters are provider/model selection, prompt/chat/refine flows,
  reference strip interaction, multishot controls, audio/voice/Suno settings,
  request assembly, and JSX rendering. Focused FlashBoard tests passed. The
  smallest safe Composer source split is the multishot presentational panel:
  its JSX is contiguous, its CSS is already isolated, and Composer can keep
  state, validation, request assembly, and helper ownership.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MULTISHOT-PANEL-SPLIT-057` to extract the active
  Multishot panel presentation from `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` without moving
  Composer state or request assembly.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MULTISHOT-PANEL-SPLIT-057`; extracted the active
  Multishot panel presentation to `FlashBoardMultishotPanel.tsx`.
  `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` still owns multishot state, helper functions,
  validation, request assembly, and callbacks. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now
  3847 LOC and `FlashBoardMultishotPanel.tsx` is 91 LOC. Focused FlashBoard
  tests and `npx tsc -b --pretty false` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-STRIP-PREFLIGHT-058` to classify the
  reference-strip extraction boundary before moving reference JSX or
  interaction code.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-STRIP-PREFLIGHT-058`; read-only scans show
  reference badge derivation, hover state, role mutation, focus/auto-scroll,
  drag/drop, and JSX are still in `FlashBoardComposer.tsx`. The safest next
  source slice is presentation-only: move the reference strip JSX and badge type
  to a role component while Composer keeps badge derivation, refs,
  pointer/focus/auto-scroll handlers, hover updates, role mutation, drag/drop,
  and store updates. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-STRIP-PRESENTATION-SPLIT-059` to extract
  reference strip presentation without moving interaction or store logic.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-STRIP-PRESENTATION-SPLIT-059`; extracted
  reference strip presentation and `ComposerReferenceBadge` to
  `FlashBoardReferenceStrip.tsx`. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` keeps badge
  derivation, refs, focus/auto-scroll callbacks, hover updates, role mutation,
  drag/drop, and store updates. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 3767 LOC and
  `FlashBoardReferenceStrip.tsx` is 121 LOC. Focused FlashBoard tests and
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-INTERACTION-PREFLIGHT-060` to classify
  whether the next Composer source split should move reference focus/auto-scroll
  into a hook or handle drag/drop/store mutation separately.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-INTERACTION-PREFLIGHT-060`; read-only scans
  show remaining reference interaction has two separate clusters. Focus and
  auto-scroll are local DOM/ref behavior in `FlashBoardComposer.tsx`, while
  drag/drop and role mutation touch Composer/store state. Focused FlashBoard
  tests passed. The next safe source split is the focus/auto-scroll hook first.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-FOCUS-HOOK-SPLIT-061` to move reference
  focus and auto-scroll refs/callbacks into a local hook while keeping drag/drop
  and store updates in Composer.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-FOCUS-HOOK-SPLIT-061`; moved reference
  focus, auto-scroll refs, RAF state, pointer callbacks, reset/leave behavior,
  and cleanup into `useFlashBoardReferenceFocus.ts`. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx`
  keeps drag/drop, hover, role mutation, store updates, and request assembly.
  `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 3633 LOC and the focus hook is 151 LOC.
  Focused FlashBoard tests and `npx tsc -b --pretty false` passed.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-DROP-PREFLIGHT-062`; read-only scans classify
  reference drag/drop as a narrow hook boundary. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is
  3633 LOC before the source split. Drag-over/drop state, MIME/payload parsing,
  reference append/clamp, and the reference-list `updateComposer` mutation can
  move together without changing role mutation, hover updates, request assembly,
  CSS, stores, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview,
  or media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-DROP-HOOK-SPLIT-063`; moved reference
  drag-over/drop state, MIME/payload parsing, duplicate filtering, and
  reference append/clamp update wiring into `useFlashBoardReferenceDrop.ts`.
  `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` still owns role mutation, hover updates,
  `FlashBoardReferenceStrip`, provider settings, prompt/request assembly, and
  submit behavior. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 3583 LOC and the drop hook
  is 109 LOC. Focused FlashBoard tests, `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, and
  `git diff --check` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-EDITOR-PREFLIGHT-064` to classify the next
  prompt editor, prompt-refine, and chat-input boundary before any additional
  Composer source split.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-EDITOR-PREFLIGHT-064`; read-only scans show a
  safe presentation-only prompt editor boundary. Prompt/chat textarea refs,
  autosize calls, prompt text inputs, Suno lyrics/style/negative inputs, clear
  actions, restore-before-rewrite button, and reference-count hint can move to a
  component with callback props. Prompt-refine service calls, chat output/history
  rendering, chat provider settings, request assembly, queue submit, CSS, stores,
  services, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and
  media runtime must stay out of the next split. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-EDITOR-SHELL-SPLIT-065` to extract only the
  prompt/chat input presentation shell into `FlashBoardPromptEditor.tsx`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-EDITOR-SHELL-SPLIT-065`; extracted prompt/chat
  input presentation, Suno lyrics/style/negative input fields, clear/restore
  buttons, autosize callback wiring, and reference-count hint into
  `FlashBoardPromptEditor.tsx`. Composer keeps prompt/chat state,
  prompt-refine service calls, chat output/history, provider controls, request
  assembly, and submit behavior. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 3506 LOC and
  `FlashBoardPromptEditor.tsx` is 173 LOC. Focused FlashBoard tests,
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-OUTPUT-PREFLIGHT-066` to classify chat output and
  chat-history presentation before any chat source split.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-OUTPUT-PREFLIGHT-066`; read-only scans show chat
  output/history as a safe presentation-only boundary. Chat log rendering,
  copied-message visual state, error-message rendering, and error cloud-action
  buttons can move to a component with callback props. Chat provider settings,
  `sendFlashBoardChatMessage`, prompt input, chat state mutation,
  clear/copy handlers, request assembly, queue submit, CSS, stores, services,
  project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media
  runtime must stay out of the next split. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-OUTPUT-SHELL-SPLIT-067` to extract only chat
  output/history presentation into `FlashBoardChatOutput.tsx`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-OUTPUT-SHELL-SPLIT-067`; extracted chat log,
  copied-message visual state, error rendering, and chat error cloud-action
  buttons into `FlashBoardChatOutput.tsx`. Composer keeps `chatHistoryRef`,
  chat state, copied-message state, clear/copy handlers, provider settings,
  `sendFlashBoardChatMessage`, prompt input, request assembly, and submit
  behavior. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 3473 LOC and
  `FlashBoardChatOutput.tsx` is 77 LOC. Focused FlashBoard tests,
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-CONTROLS-PREFLIGHT-068` to classify chat provider,
  model, reasoning, temperature, approval, and clear-history controls before any
  chat-controls source split.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-CONTROLS-PREFLIGHT-068`; read-only scans show the
  chat controls/provider bar as a safe presentation boundary. Provider/model/
  reasoning/temperature popover presentation, auto-approval toggle, clear-history
  button, Lemonade status label, and selected chat model label can move to a
  component with callback props. Chat service calls, provider/model state
  ownership, prompt input, chat output, request assembly, queue submit, CSS,
  stores, services, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export,
  preview, and media runtime must stay out of the next split. The chat send/stop
  action button remains in Composer for now because it shares the action stack
  with normal generation. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-CONTROLS-SHELL-SPLIT-069` to extract only the chat
  controls/provider presentation bar into `FlashBoardChatControls.tsx`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-CONTROLS-SHELL-SPLIT-069`; extracted chat
  provider/model/reasoning/temperature popover presentation, auto-approval
  toggle presentation, clear-history button, Lemonade status label, and selected
  chat model label into `FlashBoardChatControls.tsx`. Composer keeps popover
  state ownership, provider/model state ownership, chat service calls, prompt
  input, chat output, chat send/stop action button, request assembly, and submit
  behavior. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 3354 LOC and
  `FlashBoardChatControls.tsx` is 238 LOC. Focused FlashBoard tests,
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-ACTION-STACK-PREFLIGHT-070` to classify the shared
  generate/chat action button stack before any action-stack source split.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-ACTION-STACK-PREFLIGHT-070`; read-only scans show the
  shared generate/chat action stack is a safe presentation-only boundary. The
  action-stack shell, SVG icons, button classes, disabled state, labels, and
  precomputed title strings can move to a focused component with callback props.
  Composer keeps `handleGenerate`, `handleChatButtonClick`, `currentPrice`,
  `generateActionLabel`, request assembly, `sendFlashBoardChatMessage`,
  `submitFlashBoardActiveGenerationRequest`, provider state, prompt input, CSS,
  stores, services, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export,
  preview, and media runtime. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is 3354 LOC; focused
  FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-ACTION-STACK-SHELL-SPLIT-071` to extract only the
  generate/chat send-stop action stack into `FlashBoardActionStack.tsx`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-ACTION-STACK-SHELL-SPLIT-071`; extracted the shared
  generate/chat send-stop button stack into `FlashBoardActionStack.tsx`.
  Composer now passes primitive labels, precomputed titles, `chatPanelOpen`,
  `canGenerate`, and callback props while keeping `handleGenerate`,
  `handleChatButtonClick`, price computation, request assembly, chat service
  calls, queue submit, provider state, prompt input, CSS, stores, services,
  project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media
  runtime. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 3322 LOC and
  `FlashBoardActionStack.tsx` is 70 LOC. Focused FlashBoard tests,
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-CONTROLS-PREFLIGHT-072` to classify the
  remaining normal generation control stack and model/audio/Suno/parameter
  popovers before any further Composer source split.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-CONTROLS-PREFLIGHT-072`; read-only scans
  show the normal generation popover contents are still coupled to provider
  selection, price estimates, ElevenLabs/Suno state mutation, and prompt-refine
  service triggers. The smallest safe next source split is the control-shell
  and pill-row presentation only, with existing popover JSX passed as children.
  Composer keeps popover content, `handleProviderChange`, price estimates,
  audio/Suno state ownership, prompt-refine implementation, request assembly,
  CSS, stores, services, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export,
  preview, and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-CONTROL-SHELL-SPLIT-073` to extract the
  non-chat control shell and pill-row presentation into
  `FlashBoardGenerationControls.tsx`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-CONTROL-SHELL-SPLIT-073`; extracted the
  non-chat generation control shell, pill-row presentation, selected model
  label, and popover host wrapper into `FlashBoardGenerationControls.tsx`.
  Existing model/audio/Suno/parameter popover JSX is passed as children, so
  Composer still owns popover contents, `handleProviderChange`, price
  estimates, audio/Suno state mutation, prompt-refine implementation, request
  assembly, CSS, stores, services, project schema, Media Board, Timeline,
  render, export, preview, and media runtime. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now
  3244 LOC and `FlashBoardGenerationControls.tsx` is 209 LOC. Focused
  FlashBoard tests, `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-POPOVERS-PREFLIGHT-074` to classify the
  remaining model/audio/Suno/parameter popovers before moving any popover
  content out of Composer.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-POPOVERS-PREFLIGHT-074`; read-only scans
  show model picker and generic parameter popovers still depend on provider
  selection and price estimates, while ElevenLabs popovers depend on voice/model
  loading, preview, and local voice state. The Suno model/mode/tuning popover
  group is the smallest safe source boundary because it can move as pure
  presentation with primitive values and callback props. Composer keeps
  provider selection, price estimates, ElevenLabs state/loading/preview, generic
  parameter estimates, prompt-refine implementation, request assembly, CSS,
  stores, services, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export,
  preview, and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-SUNO-POPOVERS-SHELL-SPLIT-075` to extract only the
  Suno model, Suno mode, and Suno tuning popover presentation into
  `FlashBoardSunoPopovers.tsx`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-SUNO-POPOVERS-SHELL-SPLIT-075`; extracted Suno model,
  Suno mode, and Suno tuning popover presentation into
  `FlashBoardSunoPopovers.tsx`. Composer passes primitive values, option lists,
  close callbacks, tuning setters, model setter, mode setter, and reset callback;
  Composer still owns Suno state, version normalization, reset logic,
  prompt-refine behavior, request assembly, services, stores, CSS, project
  schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime.
  `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 3170 LOC and `FlashBoardSunoPopovers.tsx` is

  `git diff --check` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-ELEVENLABS-POPOVERS-PREFLIGHT-076` to classify the
  ElevenLabs model, voice, output, and voice-settings popovers before moving
  any ElevenLabs popover content out of Composer.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-ELEVENLABS-POPOVERS-PREFLIGHT-076`; read-only scans
  show the Voice popover is still coupled to voice-list loading, search state,
  preview playback, manual voice fields, and hosted/local availability copy. The
  smallest safe next source split is the ElevenLabs settings popover group:
  model selector, output/language options, and voice-settings controls.
  Composer keeps the Voice picker, voice loading/search/preview/manual fields,
  output normalization, voice-setting mutation, request assembly, services,
  stores, CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview,
  and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-ELEVENLABS-SETTINGS-POPOVERS-SPLIT-077` to extract only
  the ElevenLabs model, output, and voice-settings popover presentation into
  `FlashBoardElevenLabsSettingsPopovers.tsx`.
- Completed bounded packet:

  ElevenLabs model selector, output/language options, and voice-settings
  popover presentation into `FlashBoardElevenLabsSettingsPopovers.tsx`. The
  Voice picker stays in Composer because it still owns voice-list loading,
  search state, preview playback, manual voice fields, and hosted/local empty
  copy. Composer also keeps output normalization, voice-setting mutation,
  request assembly, services, stores, CSS, project schema, Media Board,
  Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx`
  is now 3075 LOC and `FlashBoardElevenLabsSettingsPopovers.tsx` is 168 LOC.
  Focused FlashBoard tests, `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, and `git diff --check`
  passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-ELEVENLABS-VOICE-POPOVER-PREFLIGHT-078` to classify the
  remaining ElevenLabs Voice picker before moving its loading/search/preview
  presentation.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-ELEVENLABS-VOICE-POPOVER-PREFLIGHT-078`; read-only
  scans show the Voice picker presentation can move without moving voice-loading
  effects or preview playback. Composer should keep voice-list loading/search
  effects, `handleSelectVoice`, `handlePreviewVoice`, hosted/local access
  decisions, voice state ownership, request assembly, services, stores, CSS,
  project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media
  runtime. The next source packet passes a primitive voice-option list, empty
  message, manual field values, loading/error state, and callback props to a
  focused Voice picker component. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-ELEVENLABS-VOICE-POPOVER-SPLIT-079` to extract only the
  ElevenLabs Voice picker presentation into

  options, selected voice id, loading/error/empty text, search/manual-field
  values, and callback props. Composer keeps voice-loading effects,
  `handleSelectVoice`, `handlePreviewVoice`, hosted/local access decisions,
  voice state ownership, request assembly, services, stores, CSS, project
  schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime.
  `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 3029 LOC and
  `FlashBoardElevenLabsVoicePopover.tsx` is 122 LOC. Focused FlashBoard tests,

  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-PARAMETER-POPOVERS-PREFLIGHT-080` to
  classify the remaining model picker and generic aspect, duration, image-size,
  and mode popovers before moving any of that presentation.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-PARAMETER-POPOVERS-PREFLIGHT-080`;
  read-only scans show the model picker still depends on provider categories,
  provider switching, selected-entry state, and per-entry price estimates. The
  generic aspect, duration, image-size, and mode popovers are the smallest safe
  next source boundary if Composer keeps `selectedEntry`, price estimation,
  option planning, current parameter state, request assembly, services, stores,
  CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and
  media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-PARAMETER-POPOVERS-SPLIT-081` to extract
  only generic aspect, duration, image-size, and mode popover presentation into

  with labels, active state, optional credit text, and callbacks. Composer keeps
  the model picker, selected entry, price estimation, option planning,
  parameter state ownership, request assembly, services, stores, CSS, project
  schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime.
  `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 3008 LOC and
  `FlashBoardParameterPopovers.tsx` is 107 LOC. Focused FlashBoard tests,

- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MODEL-POPOVER-PREFLIGHT-082` to classify the remaining
  model picker, provider category tabs, provider switching, and per-entry price
  estimates before moving model picker presentation or adding a planner.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MODEL-POPOVER-PREFLIGHT-082`; read-only scans show the
  model picker can move as presentation if Composer keeps provider category
  grouping, active-category state, selected-entry state, per-entry price/source
  label computation, and `handleProviderChange`. The next source packet passes
  primitive category and entry DTOs plus callback props to a focused model
  picker component; Composer keeps provider switching, catalog types, price
  services, request assembly, services, stores, CSS, project schema, Media
  Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime. Focused
  FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MODEL-POPOVER-SPLIT-083` to extract only model picker
  presentation into `FlashBoardModelPopover.tsx`.

- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-SUBMIT-PIPELINE-PREFLIGHT-084` to classify generation
  validation, request assembly, price/action labels, and submit orchestration
  before moving any business logic out of Composer.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-SUBMIT-PIPELINE-PREFLIGHT-084`; read-only scans show
  validation/action-label state and submit queue orchestration should stay in
  Composer for now. The narrow safe source boundary is the generation request
  payload builder inside `handleGenerate`: it can move as a pure planner that
  receives primitive/composer values and returns `FlashBoardGenerationRequest`.
  Composer keeps `canGenerate`, `currentPrice`, button labels/titles,
  validation errors, `submitFlashBoardActiveGenerationRequest`, queue submit,
  prompt-refine, stores, services, CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline,
  render, export, preview, and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.

  validation errors, `canGenerate`, current price, and action labels before
  moving any derived action-state logic.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-VALIDATION-ACTION-STATE-PREFLIGHT-086`; read-only
  scans show validation errors, current price, button labels/titles, and
  `canGenerate` form a coherent pure derived-state boundary. The next source
  packet can extract this into a planner that receives primitive/composer,
  provider, pricing, auth, and validation inputs and returns derived action
  state. Composer keeps prompt-refine, provider switching, request builder,
  `handleGenerate` submit guard, `submitFlashBoardActiveGenerationRequest`,
  stores, queue submit, CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render,
  export, preview, and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.

  primitive/composer values, selected-entry capabilities, auth/key flags, price
  inputs, prompt length, multishot state, Seedance validation result, and
  ElevenLabs/Suno settings. Composer keeps prompt-refine, provider switching,
  request builder calls, `handleGenerate` submit guard,
  `submitFlashBoardActiveGenerationRequest`, stores, queue submit, CSS, project
  schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime.
  `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 2829 LOC and
  `FlashBoardGenerationActionStatePlanner.ts` is 277 LOC. Focused FlashBoard
  tests, `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROVIDER-TRANSITION-PREFLIGHT-088` to classify
  provider switching, parameter resets, and composer patch assembly before
  moving any provider-transition logic.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROVIDER-TRANSITION-PREFLIGHT-088`; read-only scans
  show provider transition is a coherent pure planner boundary. The current
  Composer block sets local provider ids, resolves the selected catalog entry,
  picks the first supported version, resets unsupported mode/duration/aspect
  ratio/image-size values, and assembles the composer patch for output type,
  audio flags, multishot data, media references, ElevenLabs voice settings,
  and Suno settings. The next source packet can move that derived transition
  decision into a planner while Composer keeps React setters, `updateComposer`,
  popover closing, provider option planning, prompt-refine, submit
  orchestration, stores, services with side effects, CSS, project schema, Media
  Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime. Focused
  FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROVIDER-TRANSITION-PLANNER-SPLIT-089` to extract only
  pure provider-transition planning into

- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROVIDER-TRANSITION-PLANNER-SPLIT-089`; extracted pure
  provider-transition planning into
  `FlashBoardProviderTransitionPlanner.ts`. Composer still owns selected-entry
  lookup, React setters for service/provider/version/mode/duration/aspect
  ratio/image size, `updateComposer`, popover closing, provider option
  planning, prompt-refine, submit orchestration, stores, services with side
  effects, CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview,
  and media runtime. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 2825 LOC and
  `FlashBoardProviderTransitionPlanner.ts` is 152 LOC. Focused FlashBoard

- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-SYNC-PREFLIGHT-090` to classify the Composer
  sync effect that mirrors local provider/audio/Suno/ElevenLabs state into the
  persisted composer patch.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-SYNC-PREFLIGHT-090`; read-only scans show the
  Composer sync effect is a coherent pure patch-planner boundary. It derives
  the persisted composer patch from selected-entry output type, service,
  provider, version, effective audio state, multishot prompts, ElevenLabs voice
  fields, Suno fields, audio/media-reference cleanup rules, and reference-media
  clamping output. Composer should keep the `useEffect` lifecycle,
  `updateComposer`, local state setters, prompt-refine, submit orchestration,
  stores, services with side effects, CSS, project schema, Media Board,
  Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard
  tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute

- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-REFINE-PREFLIGHT-092` to classify the
  prompt-refine async controller and identify whether a pure request/input
  planner can split before any service orchestration changes.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-REFINE-PREFLIGHT-092`; read-only scans show the
  prompt-refine block mixes several responsibilities, but its request/input
  assembly is a safe pure boundary. Composer should keep hosted/BYO gating,
  auth/pricing/settings dialogs, abort-controller ownership, streaming
  callbacks, `parseSunoPromptRefinement` application, before/after restore
  state, prompt field setters, prompt-refine services, stores, CSS, project
  schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime.
  Focused FlashBoard tests passed.

  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-REFINE-INPUT-PLANNER-SPLIT-093`; extracted pure
  prompt-refine input availability and `RefineFlashBoardPromptInput` assembly
  into `FlashBoardPromptRefinePlanner.ts`. Composer keeps hosted/BYO gating,
  auth/pricing/settings dialogs, abort-controller ownership, streaming
  callbacks, `parseSunoPromptRefinement` application, before/after restore
  state, prompt field setters, prompt-refine service calls, stores, CSS,

  `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-REFINE-RESPONSE-PREFLIGHT-094` to classify Suno
  streamed response application, fallback restore behavior, and undo/clear
  state before moving any remaining prompt-refine controller logic.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-REFINE-RESPONSE-PREFLIGHT-094`; read-only scans
  show the remaining prompt-refine controller still owns async service calls,
  abort lifetime, streaming callbacks, and actual field setters, but the field
  update decisions are a safe pure boundary. The next source packet can extract
  streaming delta application, final response application, error restore
  planning, and undo restore planning as pure functions that return prompt/Suno
  field updates. Composer should keep `parseSunoPromptRefinement`, setter
  execution, abort-controller ownership, prompt-refine service calls,
  hosted/BYO gating, dialogs, stores, CSS, project schema, Media Board,
  Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard
  tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-REFINE-FIELD-PLANNER-SPLIT-095` to add pure
  prompt-refine field update planning to `FlashBoardPromptRefinePlanner.ts`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-REFINE-FIELD-PLANNER-SPLIT-095`; added pure
  prompt-refine field update planning for streaming deltas, final responses,
  error fallback restore, and undo restore to `FlashBoardPromptRefinePlanner.ts`.
  Composer still owns `parseSunoPromptRefinement`, actual React setters,
  `streamedPrompt`/`streamedSunoFields`, abort-controller ownership,
  prompt-refine service calls, hosted/BYO gating, dialogs, stores, CSS,
  project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media
  runtime. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 2767 LOC and
  `FlashBoardPromptRefinePlanner.ts` is exactly 250 LOC. Focused FlashBoard
  tests, `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-REFINE-CONTROLLER-PREFLIGHT-096` to classify
  whether the remaining prompt-refine async controller can move safely, or
  should stay in Composer while the next lane shifts to another Composer
  controller.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-REFINE-CONTROLLER-PREFLIGHT-096`; read-only
  scans show the remaining prompt-refine controller should stay in Composer for
  now. It owns hosted/BYO gating, auth/pricing/settings dialog side effects,
  abort-controller lifetime, prompt-refine service calls, streaming callback
  lifetime, setter execution, error state, and loading state. Moving it now
  would create a side-effectful wrapper rather than a cleaner pure boundary.
  Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-SEND-PREFLIGHT-097` to classify chat send gating,
  request/message planning, abort behavior, and provider-specific credential
  checks before moving any chat logic.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-SEND-PREFLIGHT-097`; read-only scans show chat
  send contains a coherent pure planning boundary. The block currently owns
  open-panel behavior, abort-on-active-chat behavior, empty prompt validation,
  OpenAI hosted/BYO credential gating with dialog target, Anthropic key gating,
  request prompt assembly, optimistic user/assistant message creation, chat
  request payload assembly, and completion/error message patching. The next
  source packet can move pure planning while Composer keeps actual dialog
  calls, AbortController lifetime, ref mutation, React setters,
  `sendFlashBoardChatMessage`, clipboard behavior, Lemonade health effects,
  stores, CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview,
  and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-SEND-PLANNER-SPLIT-098` to extract pure chat send
  gating, request/message planning, and assistant message patching into
  `FlashBoardChatSendPlanner.ts`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-SEND-PLANNER-SPLIT-098`; extracted pure chat send
  action selection, credential gating, request prompt assembly, optimistic
  message planning, chat request payload planning, and assistant response/error
  message patching into `FlashBoardChatSendPlanner.ts`. Composer still owns
  close-popover calls, dialog execution, AbortController lifetime, ref
  mutation, React setters, `sendFlashBoardChatMessage`, clipboard behavior,
  Lemonade health effects, stores, CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline,
  render, export, preview, and media runtime. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now
  2746 LOC and `FlashBoardChatSendPlanner.ts` is 155 LOC. Focused FlashBoard
  tests, `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-OPTIONS-PREFLIGHT-099` to classify chat provider
  options, Lemonade discovered model merge, active model lookup, temperature
  and reasoning-support derivation, provider fallback, and model fallback
  before moving any chat option planning.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-OPTIONS-PREFLIGHT-099`; read-only scans show chat
  model option derivation, active model lookup, temperature support, OpenAI
  reasoning support/options, provider options, provider label, hosted credit
  label, chat button/charge label, default provider model, provider fallback,
  model fallback, and reasoning-effort fallback are a coherent pure planning
  boundary. Composer should keep Lemonade health effect execution, provider and
  model React setters, chat panel state, stores, CSS, project schema, Media
  Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime. Focused
  FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-OPTIONS-PLANNER-SPLIT-100` to extract pure chat
  option derivation and fallback planning into
  `FlashBoardChatOptionsPlanner.ts`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-OPTIONS-PLANNER-SPLIT-100`; extracted pure chat
  model option derivation, active model lookup, temperature/reasoning support,
  reasoning options, provider options, labels, hosted credit labels,
  provider/model fallback, and reasoning fallback into
  `FlashBoardChatOptionsPlanner.ts`. Composer still owns Lemonade health effect
  execution, provider/model/reasoning React setters, chat panel state, stores,
  CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and
  media runtime. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 2459 LOC and

  `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, and `git diff --check` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-CONTROLLER-PREFLIGHT-101` to classify remaining
  chat controller behavior: provider selection side effects, clear history,
  prompt changes, clipboard copy, history scroll, Lemonade health side effects,
  and whether any pure command planning remains worth extracting.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-CONTROLLER-PREFLIGHT-101`; read-only scans show
  the remaining chat controller work is intentionally side-effectful and should
  stay in Composer for now: provider/model setter sequencing, panel open/error
  resets, AbortController cleanup, copied-message timeout cleanup, clipboard
  writes, history scroll refs, Lemonade health effect execution, and small
  prompt input setters. A further chat split would mostly wrap React setters,
  DOM refs, browser APIs, or service-effect lifetime. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx`
  is now 2459 LOC, `FlashBoardChatSendPlanner.ts` is 141 LOC, and
  `FlashBoardChatOptionsPlanner.ts` is 145 LOC. Focused FlashBoard tests
  passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-SUBMIT-CONTROLLER-PREFLIGHT-102` to reclassify the
  remaining generation submit controller after the later request/action-state,
  provider-transition, composer-sync, prompt-refine, and chat planner splits.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-SUBMIT-CONTROLLER-PREFLIGHT-102`; read-only scans show
  submit orchestration should stay in Composer for now. `handleGenerate` is now
  only the `canGenerate`/`selectedEntry` guard, request audio/Suno mode
  derivation, `buildFlashBoardGenerationRequest`, and
  `submitFlashBoardActiveGenerationRequest`. The request payload and
  action-state business rules are already split into
  `FlashBoardGenerationRequestPlanner.ts` and
  `FlashBoardGenerationActionStatePlanner.ts`; another submit planner would be
  a thin wrapper around queue submission and existing planners. Focused
  FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PARAMETER-OPTIONS-PREFLIGHT-103` to classify aspect,
  duration, image-size, and mode popover option derivation before moving any
  parameter option planning out of Composer.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PARAMETER-OPTIONS-PREFLIGHT-103`; read-only scans show
  aspect, duration, image-size, and mode option derivation is a coherent pure
  planning boundary. Composer currently builds the arrays inline for
  `FlashBoardParameterPopovers`, including duration/image-size/mode price
  metadata through `getFlashBoardPriceEstimate`; `FlashBoardParameterPopovers`
  only renders options and calls parameter setters plus popover close. Composer
  should keep selected-entry state, active popover state, React setters,
  popover close calls, stores, CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline,
  render, export, preview, and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PARAMETER-OPTIONS-PLANNER-SPLIT-104` to extract only
  the pure aspect/duration/image-size/mode option derivation into
  `FlashBoardParameterOptionsPlanner.ts`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PARAMETER-OPTIONS-PLANNER-SPLIT-104`; extracted pure
  aspect, duration, image-size, and mode option derivation plus price metadata
  into `FlashBoardParameterOptionsPlanner.ts`. Composer now passes the planner
  DTOs to `FlashBoardParameterPopovers` and still owns selected-entry state,
  active popover state, React setters, popover close calls, stores, CSS,
  project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media
  runtime. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 2410 LOC and

  and model price/source labels before moving any model option planning out of
  Composer.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MODEL-OPTIONS-PREFLIGHT-105`; read-only scans show
  model catalog visibility, category grouping, selected/initial entry lookup,
  active category fallback, model button labels, source labels, and model entry
  price metadata form a coherent pure planning boundary. Composer should keep
  provider switch execution, provider-transition setter/application,
  selected-entry consumers, active category setter, React setters, popover close
  calls, stores, CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export,
  preview, and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MODEL-OPTIONS-PLANNER-SPLIT-106` to extract only

- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MODEL-OPTIONS-PLANNER-SPLIT-106`; extracted model
  catalog visibility, category grouping, initial/selected entry lookup, active
  category fallback, model button label, and model popover entry DTO
  construction into `FlashBoardModelOptionsPlanner.ts`. Composer now keeps
  provider switch execution, provider-transition setter/application,
  selected-entry consumers, active category setter, React setters, popover
  close calls, stores, CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render,
  export, preview, and media runtime. `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 2300 LOC

  ElevenLabs model option fallback, selected model/limit derivation, model
  popover DTOs, voice DTOs, and selected-voice lookup before moving any
  ElevenLabs option planning out of Composer.
- Completed bounded packet:

  show ElevenLabs model fallback/options, selected model lookup, character
  limit, audio model/output labels, model meta text, output option DTOs, voice
  option DTOs, and selected-voice lookup form a coherent pure planning
  boundary. Composer should keep ElevenLabs API loading effects, refresh nonce,
  loading/error state setters, voice/model/output selection execution, stores,
  CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and
  media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed.

  ElevenLabs model fallback/options, selected model lookup, character-limit
  derivation, audio model/output labels, model meta text, output option DTOs,
  voice option DTOs, and selected-voice lookup into

  loading effects, refresh nonce, loading/error state setters,
  voice/model/output selection execution, stores, CSS, project schema, Media
  Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime.
  `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` is now 2254 LOC and

  voice/model/output selection execution, and voice-settings setters before
  moving any controller logic.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-ELEVENLABS-CONTROLLER-PREFLIGHT-109`; read-only scans
  show the remaining ElevenLabs controller behavior should stay in Composer for
  now. The remaining code owns model/voice API loading effects, AbortController
  and timeout lifetime, refresh nonce, loading/error setters, voice preview,
  voice/model/output selection execution, and voice settings setters. A further
  split would mostly wrap service calls and React setters. Focused FlashBoard
  tests passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-SUNO-OPTIONS-PREFLIGHT-110` to classify Suno model,
  mode, tuning label, tuning reset, and Suno popover option derivation before
  moving any Suno option planning out of Composer.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-SUNO-OPTIONS-PREFLIGHT-110`; read-only scans show the
  current model id normalization, Suno model button label, Suno mode button
  label, tuning-changed flag, reset defaults, model option DTOs, and vocal
  gender option DTOs can split as pure planning. Composer must keep React
  state setters, Suno model/mode/tuning selection execution, prompt-refine side

  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-SUNO-CONTROLLER-PREFLIGHT-112` to classify the
  remaining Suno model/mode/tuning setter execution, prompt-refine integration,
  and request/hydration touchpoints before any further Suno controller split.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-SUNO-CONTROLLER-PREFLIGHT-112`; read-only scans show
  the remaining Suno behavior should stay in Composer for now. The remaining
  code owns React setter execution for model/mode/tuning, `version` changes,
  prompt-refine service flow and field-update application, sync-patch
  application, request-builder invocation, and prompt restore state. Existing
  planners already own the pure Suno option state, prompt-refine field updates,
  request assembly, and sync-patch derivation. A Suno controller source split
  would mostly wrap state setters or side-effect orchestration. Focused
  FlashBoard tests passed with 5 files and 16 tests.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-113` to map the
  remaining `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` responsibilities and select the next
  narrow non-Suno source boundary.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-113`; read-only
  scans map the remaining Composer clusters as chat service controller,
  prompt-refine service controller, ElevenLabs API controller, provider/sync
  effects, multishot controller, and reference role/remove commands. The next
  safe source boundary is the reference command hook because reference focus,
  drop, and strip presentation are already split, while the role/remove command
  code only owns Composer patch calculation and hover cleanup. Focused
  FlashBoard tests passed with 5 files and 16 tests.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-COMMAND-HOOK-SPLIT-114` to extract reference
  remove and role-change callbacks into `useFlashBoardReferenceCommands.ts`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-COMMAND-HOOK-SPLIT-114`; extracted reference
  remove and role-change callbacks into `useFlashBoardReferenceCommands.ts`.
  Composer now wires the hook next to the existing reference drop and focus
  hooks, while reference badge derivation, drop parsing, focus/auto-scroll,
  strip presentation, store update execution, provider/request/sync/chat/
  prompt-refine/ElevenLabs controllers, CSS, project schema, Media Board,
  Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime remain unchanged.

  reference badge derivation can split as pure planning before moving any more
  reference source.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-BADGE-PREFLIGHT-115`; read-only scans show
  reference badge construction can split as pure planning. The extractable
  logic maps `startMediaFileId`, `endMediaFileId`, the already-clamped
  reference id list, and `mediaFilesById` into primitive badge DTOs for
  `FlashBoardReferenceStrip`. Composer must keep MediaStore reads,
  `mediaFilesById` construction, reference type guarding, drop/focus/command
  hooks, store update execution, prompt-refine reference counts, CSS, project
  schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime.

  Multishot controller logic out of Composer.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MULTISHOT-CONTROLLER-PREFLIGHT-117`; read-only scans
  show the next safe source boundary is pure Multishot planning/math, not the
  full React controller yet. Extractable logic includes max-shot limiting,

- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MULTISHOT-PLANNER-SPLIT-118` to extract only pure
  Multishot helper math into `FlashBoardMultishotPlanner.ts`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MULTISHOT-PLANNER-SPLIT-118`; extracted pure
  Multishot helper math into `FlashBoardMultishotPlanner.ts`: max-shot
  limiting, duration rebalancing, default shot creation, add/remove shot math,
  and fallback prompt construction. Composer still owns Multishot React state,
  panel open/close timeout lifetime, `setGenerateAudio` coupling, selected
  provider support checks, UI callbacks, request/sync inputs, CSS, stores,
  project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media
  runtime. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 2235 LOC,

  `FlashBoardGenerationActionStatePlanner.ts` 277 LOC. Focused FlashBoard
  tests, `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, `git diff --check`, and
  `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` passed; `git diff --check` reported only
  existing LF-to-CRLF working-copy warnings. The Multishot planner has no
  React, store, CSS, project, timeline, render/export/preview, or runtime
  imports.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MULTISHOT-CONTROLLER-HOOK-PREFLIGHT-119` to classify
  whether the remaining Multishot React state/effects/callback execution can
  split into a hook after pure math is separated.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MULTISHOT-CONTROLLER-HOOK-PREFLIGHT-119`; read-only
  scans show the remaining Multishot React state, panel open/close timeout
  lifetime, audio-forcing effect, support-reset effect, and shot-edit callbacks
  can split into a local hook if Composer injects `setGenerateAudio`, duration,
  selected output type, and provider support booleans. Composer must keep
  GenerateAudio state, provider/support derivation, request/sync inputs,
  generation control wiring, prompt-refine/chat/ElevenLabs controllers, CSS,
  stores, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and
  media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed with 5 files and 16 tests.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MULTISHOT-CONTROLLER-HOOK-SPLIT-120` to extract only
  local Multishot React state/effects/callbacks into
  `useFlashBoardMultishotController.ts`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-MULTISHOT-CONTROLLER-HOOK-SPLIT-120`; extracted local
  Multishot React state/effects/callbacks into
  `useFlashBoardMultishotController.ts`. Composer now injects duration,
  `generateAudio`, `setGenerateAudio`, audio/multishot support booleans, and
  selected output type, while keeping GenerateAudio state, provider/support
  derivation, request/sync inputs, generation control wiring,
  prompt-refine/chat/ElevenLabs controllers, CSS, stores, project schema, Media
  Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime. Current
  snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 2122 LOC,

  tests, `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, `git diff --check`, and
  `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` passed; `git diff --check` reported only
  existing LF-to-CRLF working-copy warnings. The Multishot controller hook has
  no store, service, project, Timeline, render/export/preview, Media Board, or
  media runtime dependencies.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-121` to rescan
  the remaining Composer clusters after Reference and Multishot boundaries are
  split.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-121`; re-scanned
  remaining `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` responsibilities after Reference and
  Multishot controller splits. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx`

  `FlashBoardMultishotPlanner.ts` 116 LOC, `FlashBoardReferenceBadgePlanner.ts`
  87 LOC, `FlashBoardSunoOptionsPlanner.ts` 97 LOC, and adjacent role modules
  remain under their budgets except the known `FlashBoardModelOptionsPlanner.ts`
  at 329 LOC and `FlashBoardGenerationActionStatePlanner.ts` at 277 LOC.
  Remaining Composer-owned controller clusters are chat send/lifetime and
  clipboard behavior, prompt-refine service/stream lifetime, ElevenLabs
  model/voice loading, generation submit orchestration, store/settings/account
  selectors, and persistence sync. Those stay in Composer for now because they
  are service, browser, dialog, queue, or setter orchestration. The next safe
  source boundary is the local popover controller: popover state/ref,
  open/close/toggle, outside-click and closing-timer effects, and inline submenu
  class derivation. Focused FlashBoard tests passed with 5 files and 16 tests.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-POPOVER-HOOK-SPLIT-122` to extract only local
  Composer popover UI behavior into `useFlashBoardComposerPopovers.ts`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-POPOVER-HOOK-SPLIT-122`; extracted local
  Composer popover state/ref, open/close/toggle behavior, outside-click and
  closing-timer effects, and inline submenu class derivation into
  `useFlashBoardComposerPopovers.ts`. Composer keeps model category state,
  provider transition logic, generation submit, chat, prompt-refine,
  ElevenLabs loading, Suno/voice setting setters, persistence sync, stores,
  CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media
  runtime. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 2037 LOC and
  `useFlashBoardComposerPopovers.ts` 110 LOC. The hook dependency scan stayed
  free of stores, services, CSS, Media Board, Timeline, render/export/preview,
  and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests, `npx tsc -b --pretty false`,
  `git diff --check`, and `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` passed; diff-check
  reported only existing LF-to-CRLF working-copy warnings.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-VOICE-CONTROLS-PREFLIGHT-123` to classify whether the
  remaining local ElevenLabs voice/output/settings helpers can split without
  moving ElevenLabs service loading or broader Composer controller behavior.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-VOICE-CONTROLS-PREFLIGHT-123`; classified the remaining
  ElevenLabs voice/output/settings logic. ElevenLabs model/voice loading,
  `cloudAiService`/`elevenLabsService` calls, `AbortController` lifetime,
  voice search/refresh state, and browser audio preview stay in Composer.
  Pure local helpers for voice settings normalization/equality, output-format
  normalization, numeric voice-setting parsing, speaker-boost patching, reset
  state, and voice selection can split without touching CSS, services, stores,
  project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render/export/preview, or media
  runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed with 5 files and 16 tests.
- Next eligible packet: execute

  voice settings normalization/equality, ElevenLabs output-format fallback,
  voice selection, numeric voice-setting parsing, speaker-boost patching, and
  reset-default state into `FlashBoardVoiceSettingsPlanner.ts`. Composer keeps
  ElevenLabs model/voice loading, service calls, `AbortController` lifetime,
  voice search/refresh state, browser audio preview, component setter wiring,
  stores, CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview,
  and media runtime. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 2012 LOC and
  `FlashBoardVoiceSettingsPlanner.ts` 92 LOC. The planner dependency scan
  stayed free of stores/hooks, services, CSS, Media Board, Timeline,
  render/export/preview, and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests,
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, `git diff --check`, and
  `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` passed; diff-check reported only existing
  LF-to-CRLF working-copy warnings.

  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-125`; re-scanned
  remaining `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` responsibilities after popover and
  voice-settings planner splits. Composer remains at 2012 LOC. Store/settings/
  account selectors, model/category state, ElevenLabs loading effects, chat
  service lifetime, prompt-refine service lifetime, generation submit, dialog
  calls, browser clipboard/audio preview APIs, persistence sync, and JSX assembly
  stay in Composer. The next safe source boundary is local prompt textarea
  autosize behavior: `promptInputRef`, `chatInputRef`, `resizePromptInput`, and
  the layout effect that resizes the active prompt input. Focused FlashBoard
  tests passed with 5 files and 16 tests.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-AUTOSIZE-HOOK-SPLIT-126` to extract only prompt
  textarea refs/autosize into `useFlashBoardPromptAutosize.ts`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-AUTOSIZE-HOOK-SPLIT-126`; extracted local prompt
  textarea refs, resize function, and active-input layout resize effect into
  `useFlashBoardPromptAutosize.ts`. `FlashBoardPromptEditor.tsx` props stayed
  unchanged. Composer keeps prompt/chat state setters, prompt-refine, chat,
  submit, dialogs, browser clipboard/audio preview, persistence sync, stores,
  CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media
  runtime. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 2000 LOC and
  `useFlashBoardPromptAutosize.ts` 48 LOC. The hook dependency scan stayed free
  of stores/hooks, services, CSS, Media Board, Timeline, render/export/preview,
  and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests, `npx tsc -b --pretty false`,
  `git diff --check`, and `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` passed; diff-check

  whether any remaining Composer code can split without wrapping controller
  service lifetimes.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-127`; re-scanned
  remaining `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` responsibilities after prompt autosize.
  Composer remains at 2000 LOC. Store/settings/account selectors,
  model/category state, ElevenLabs loading effects, chat service lifetime,
  prompt-refine service lifetime, generation submit, dialog calls, browser
  clipboard/audio preview APIs, persistence sync, and JSX assembly stay in
  Composer. The next safe source boundary is local chat-history scroll behavior:
  `chatHistoryRef` and the layout effect that scrolls the chat output after chat
  messages or chat errors change. Focused FlashBoard tests passed with 5 files
  and 16 tests.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-HISTORY-SCROLL-HOOK-SPLIT-128` to extract only
  chat-history scroll ref/effect into `useFlashBoardChatHistoryScroll.ts`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-HISTORY-SCROLL-HOOK-SPLIT-128`; extracted local
  chat-history scroll ref/effect into `useFlashBoardChatHistoryScroll.ts`.
  `FlashBoardChatOutput.tsx` props stayed unchanged. Composer keeps chat state
  setters, chat send/clear/copy handlers, chat service lifetime, prompt-refine,
  submit, dialogs, browser clipboard/audio preview, persistence sync, stores,
  CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media
  runtime. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 1995 LOC and

  Composer remains at 1995 LOC. Store/settings/account selectors,
  model/category state, ElevenLabs loading effects, Lemonade health effect,
  chat service lifetime, prompt-refine service lifetime, generation submit,
  dialog calls, browser clipboard/audio preview APIs, persistence sync, and JSX
  assembly stay in Composer. The next safe source boundary is local initial
  entry sync: `appliedInitialTargetRef`, `initialTargetKey`, and the effect that
  applies `initialEntry`/`initialVersion` to local service/provider/version/mode/
  duration/aspect/image-size state. Focused FlashBoard tests passed with 5
  files and 16 tests.
- Next eligible packet: execute

  provider transition, generation submit, chat, prompt-refine, ElevenLabs
  loading, Lemonade health, persistence sync, stores, CSS, project schema, Media
  Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media runtime. Current
  snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 1955 LOC and

  Composer remains at 1955 LOC. Store/settings/account selectors,
  model/category state, ElevenLabs loading effects, Lemonade health effect,
  chat service lifetime, prompt-refine service lifetime, generation submit,
  dialog calls, browser clipboard/audio preview APIs, persistence sync, and JSX
  assembly stay in Composer. The next safe source boundary is pure reference
  media helper logic: referenceable media type classification, reference id
  dedupe/limit clamping, and reference id append/dedupe. Focused FlashBoard
  tests passed with 5 files and 16 tests.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-MEDIA-PLANNER-SPLIT-132` to extract only pure
  reference media helper logic into `FlashBoardReferenceMediaPlanner.ts`.

  clipboard/audio preview APIs, persistence sync, JSX assembly, existing
  reference hook/component contracts, provider transition, sync modules, stores,
  CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and

  `FlashBoardReferenceMediaPlanner.ts` 37 LOC. The planner dependency scan
  stayed free of stores/hooks, services, browser APIs, CSS, Media Board,
  Timeline, render/export/preview, and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests
  passed with 5 files and 16 tests; `npx tsc -b --pretty false`,

  reported only existing LF-to-CRLF working-copy warnings.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-133` to rescan
  the remaining Composer clusters and choose the next coherent boundary before
  any further source refactor.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-133`; re-scanned
  remaining `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` responsibilities after the reference-media
  planner split. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 1806 LOC,
  `FlashBoardControls.css` 895 LOC, `FlashBoardPopovers.css` 633 LOC, and all
  adjacent FlashBoard TS/TSX role modules are below 300 LOC except the accepted
  `FlashBoardModelOptionsPlanner.ts` at 288 LOC. JSX assembly from line 1624 is
  still broad enough that a view extraction would mostly become a prop funnel.
  The next coherent source boundary is the local ElevenLabs controller:
  model/voice list loading, hosted/local ElevenLabs service selection, voice
  search/refresh state, voice preview audio, voice selection, output format, and
  voice settings setters. It can move to a hook without touching stores,
  project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, or media
  runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed with 5 files and 16 tests.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-ELEVENLABS-CONTROLLER-HOOK-SPLIT-134` to extract only
  the local ElevenLabs controller into `useFlashBoardElevenLabsController.ts`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-ELEVENLABS-CONTROLLER-HOOK-SPLIT-134`; extracted local
  ElevenLabs model/voice loading, hosted/local service selection, voice search
  and refresh state, voice preview audio, voice selection, output format,
  language override/code, and voice settings callbacks into
  `useFlashBoardElevenLabsController.ts`. Composer injects settings/account
  inputs and shared `version`/`setVersion`, and still owns provider/model
  selection, composer sync, generation request/submit, chat, prompt-refine,
  Suno, stores, CSS, project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export,
  preview, and media runtime. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 1647
  LOC and `useFlashBoardElevenLabsController.ts` 274 LOC. Composer no longer
  directly imports `elevenLabsService`, `cloudAiService`, or creates preview
  audio; the hook dependency scan stayed free of stores, submit/chat/refine,
  clipboard, CSS, Media Board, Timeline, render/export/preview, and media
  runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed with 5 files and 16 tests;
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, `git diff --check`, and
  `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` passed; diff-check reported only existing
  LF-to-CRLF working-copy warnings.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-135` to rescan
  the remaining Composer clusters and choose the next coherent boundary before
  any further source refactor.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-135`; re-scanned
  remaining `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` responsibilities after the ElevenLabs
  controller hook split. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 1647 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardElevenLabsController.ts` 274 LOC, `FlashBoardControls.css` 895
  LOC, and `FlashBoardPopovers.css` 633 LOC. Chat state and lifetime are now
  the next coherent source boundary: `sendFlashBoardChatMessage`,
  `checkLemonadeHealth`, `chatAbortRef`, copied-message timeout cleanup,
  provider/model/reasoning fallback, chat send/open/abort/error handling,
  history clear, input change/clear/key handling, and assistant-response
  clipboard copy are one local controller. Prompt-refine is similarly
  side-effectful but remains more tightly coupled to Suno/prompt field state;
  provider transition, composer sync, generation request/submit, validation
  warnings, and JSX assembly stay in Composer for now. Focused FlashBoard tests
  passed with 5 files and 16 tests; `git diff --check` and
  `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` passed with only existing LF-to-CRLF
  warnings from diff-check.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-CONTROLLER-HOOK-SPLIT-136` to extract only the
  local chat controller into `useFlashBoardChatController.ts`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-CHAT-CONTROLLER-HOOK-SPLIT-136`; extracted local chat
  panel state, prompt, provider/model/temperature/reasoning state, message
  history, copied-message state, error/is-chatting state, Lemonade health/model
  state, chat options, send/open/abort/error handling, clear-history,
  input-change/clear/key handling, assistant-response clipboard copy, and chat
  cleanup into `useFlashBoardChatController.ts`. Composer injects API keys,
  account/settings capability flags, dialog callbacks, `closePopover`, and
  hosted-provider policy, and still owns prompt-refine, generation submit,
  provider switching, composer sync, Suno, validation warnings, stores, CSS,
  project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, and media
  runtime. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 1427 LOC and
  `useFlashBoardChatController.ts` 337 LOC. Composer no longer directly owns
  `sendFlashBoardChatMessage`, `checkLemonadeHealth`, chat abort refs,
  copied-message timeout refs, or `navigator.clipboard`; the hook dependency
  scan stayed free of stores, generation submit, prompt-refine, ElevenLabs/
  cloud services, CSS, Media Board, Timeline, render/export/preview, and media
  runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed with 5 files and 16 tests;
  `npx tsc -b --pretty false`, `git diff --check`, and
  `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` passed; diff-check reported only existing
  LF-to-CRLF working-copy warnings.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-137` to rescan
  the remaining Composer clusters and choose the next coherent boundary before
  any further source refactor.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-137`; re-scanned
  remaining `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` responsibilities after the chat controller
  hook split. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 1427 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardChatController.ts` 337 LOC, and
  `useFlashBoardElevenLabsController.ts` 274 LOC. Prompt-refine is the next
  coherent source boundary: hosted/BYO prompt-refine service calls,
  `promptRefineAbortRef`, streaming delta application, undo/error restore,
  prompt-refine error/refining state, and before-rewrite snapshots form one
  local controller. It is coupled to Suno/prompt fields, but those can be
  injected as state and setter inputs without touching stores, services,
  project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, or media
  runtime. Provider transition, composer sync, generation request/submit,
  Suno tuning reset, validation warnings, and JSX assembly stay in Composer.
  Focused FlashBoard tests passed with 5 files and 16 tests; `git diff
  --check` and `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` passed with only existing
  LF-to-CRLF warnings from diff-check.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-REFINE-CONTROLLER-HOOK-SPLIT-138`; extracted
  the local prompt-refine controller into
  `useFlashBoardPromptRefineController.ts`. Composer now injects prompt/Suno
  values and setters, selected model inputs, reference badge/media lookup, Cloud
  capability/dialog callbacks, and popover close behavior, while the hook owns
  prompt-refine error/refining state, before-rewrite snapshots, abort cleanup,
  hosted/BYO service execution, streaming delta/final/error application, and
  undo restore. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 1298 LOC and
  `useFlashBoardPromptRefineController.ts` 362 LOC. Composer no longer imports
  `FlashBoardPromptRefiner` services or `FlashBoardPromptRefinePlanner`
  builders/types. The hook dependency scan stayed free of stores, chat submit,
  ElevenLabs/cloud services, clipboard, CSS, Media Board, Timeline,
  render/export/preview, and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests passed with
  5 files and 16 tests; `npx tsc -b --pretty false` and
  `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` passed.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-139`; re-scanned
  remaining `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` responsibilities after the prompt-refine
  controller split. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 1298 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardPromptRefineController.ts` 362 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardChatController.ts` 373 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardElevenLabsController.ts` 302 LOC,
  `FlashBoardControls.css` 1035 LOC, and `FlashBoardPopovers.css` 718 LOC.
  Prompt-refine ownership stayed in the prompt-refine hook; Composer only
  consumes returned handlers/state. The next coherent source boundary is
  generation flow orchestration: `buildFlashBoardComposerSyncPatch`,
  `buildFlashBoardProviderTransition`, `buildFlashBoardGenerationRequest`,
  `submitFlashBoardActiveGenerationRequest`, `handleProviderChange`, and
  `handleGenerate` are concentrated in Composer with the existing planner
  modules already split. JSX extraction remains premature because it would still
  be mostly prop forwarding. CSS overages remain known but should wait for a CSS
  packet. Source stayed untouched during the preflight; `git diff --check` and
  `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` are the required closing checks.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-GENERATION-FLOW-CONTROLLER-HOOK-SPLIT-140`; extracted
  the local generation-flow orchestration into
  `useFlashBoardGenerationFlowController.ts`. Composer now injects current
  state, setters, catalog data, `updateComposer`, generation-action state, and
  primitive planner inputs, while the hook owns the composer sync effect,
  provider transition handler, generation request/submit handler, Ctrl/Cmd+Enter
  generate keydown, and generation audio toggle. Current snapshots:
  `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 1084 LOC and
  `useFlashBoardGenerationFlowController.ts` 378 LOC. Composer no longer imports
  `submitFlashBoardActiveGenerationRequest`,
  `buildFlashBoardGenerationRequest`, `buildFlashBoardComposerSyncPatch`, or
  `buildFlashBoardProviderTransition`; it only consumes returned generation
  handlers. The hook dependency scan stayed free of store hooks, media/settings/
  account stores, prompt-refine/chat/ElevenLabs services, CSS, Media Board,
  Timeline, render/export/preview, WebGPU, and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard
  tests passed with 5 files and 16 tests; `npx tsc -b --pretty false` passed.

  `FlashBoardControls.css` 1035 LOC, and `FlashBoardPopovers.css` 718 LOC.
  Generation-flow ownership stayed in `useFlashBoardGenerationFlowController`;
  Composer only consumes returned generation handlers. The next coherent source
  boundary is the local prompt/Suno controller: prompt state, Suno field state,
  Suno option derivation, prompt/Suno field-change handlers, clear-prompt
  coordination, effective prompt derivation, and Suno tuning reset are still
  local in Composer and can be extracted without touching stores, services,
  project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render, export, preview, media runtime,
  CSS, chat, ElevenLabs, prompt-refine services, or existing component/planner
  contracts. JSX extraction remains premature because it would still be mostly
  prop forwarding; reference/validation extraction has more store/reference
  coupling and should wait for a dedicated boundary.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-PROMPT-SUNO-CONTROLLER-HOOK-SPLIT-142`; extracted the
  local prompt/Suno controller into
  `useFlashBoardPromptSunoController.ts`. Composer now injects composer initial
  Suno values, `isSunoMode`, multishot state, version, and a narrow
  prompt-refine callback ref, while the hook owns prompt text state, Suno field
  state, Suno option derivation, effective-prompt fallback, prompt/Suno
  field-change handlers, clear-prompt coordination, vocal-gender selection, and
  Suno tuning reset. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 996 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardPromptSunoController.ts` 163 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardGenerationFlowController.ts` 362 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardPromptRefineController.ts` 336 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardChatController.ts` 337 LOC, and
  `useFlashBoardElevenLabsController.ts` 274 LOC. Composer no longer imports
  Suno defaults, Suno options builders, fallback-prompt helpers, or the Suno
  vocal-gender type; it only consumes returned prompt/Suno state and handlers.
  The new hook dependency scan stayed free of store hooks, generation submit,
  chat/ElevenLabs/prompt-refine services, CSS, Media Board, Timeline,
  render/export/preview, WebGPU, and media runtime. Focused FlashBoard tests
  passed with 5 files and 16 tests; `npx tsc -b --pretty false` passed;
  `git diff --check` passed with only LF/CRLF warnings; `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md
  CLAUDE.md` passed.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-143` to re-scan
  the remaining Composer responsibilities after the prompt/Suno controller
  split, then define the next bounded source packet from that scan.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-COMPOSER-REMAINING-BOUNDARY-PREFLIGHT-143`; re-scanned
  remaining `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` responsibilities after the prompt/Suno
  controller split. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx` 996 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardPromptSunoController.ts` 163 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardGenerationFlowController.ts` 362 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardPromptRefineController.ts` 336 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardChatController.ts` 337 LOC,
  `useFlashBoardElevenLabsController.ts` 274 LOC,
  `FlashBoardControls.css` 895 LOC, and `FlashBoardPopovers.css` 633 LOC.
  The remaining coherent clusters are model/catalog/parameter derivation and
  popover selection, reference/Seedance validation and badge/drop/command
  coordination, validation warning/cloud-action assembly, and final JSX
  composition. The next source boundary is a local reference controller hook
  because it composes already-split reference helpers, keeps stale-reference
  protection inside a ref instead of Composer `getState()`, and can return
  reference ids/badges/drop handlers/validation values without touching stores,
  project schema, Media Board, Timeline, render/export/preview, media runtime,
  CSS, chat, ElevenLabs, prompt/Suno, prompt-refine, generation submit, or
  provider switching. Source stayed untouched during this preflight.
- Next eligible packet: execute
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-CONTROLLER-HOOK-SPLIT-144` to extract only
  the remaining reference/Seedance controller composition into
  `useFlashBoardReferenceController.ts`.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-ACTIVE-REFERENCE-CONTROLLER-HOOK-SPLIT-144`; extracted the
  local reference/Seedance controller composition into
  `useFlashBoardReferenceController.ts`. Composer injects composer state, media
  files, selected entry, provider id, mode booleans, `updateComposer`, and the
  hovered-reference setter, and consumes returned reference ids, badges,
  Seedance validation values, support booleans, drop/command handlers, and
  reference style inputs; stale-drop protection moved behind a local ref
  instead of a Composer store read. Current snapshots: `FlashBoardComposer.tsx`
  951 LOC and `useFlashBoardReferenceController.ts` 202 LOC. The worker
  executing this packet was stopped before running its checks; the orchestrator
  closed the packet retroactively: `npx tsc -b --pretty false` clean, focused
  FlashBoard tests passed with 5 files and 16 tests, the hook dependency scan
  stayed free of store hooks/services/CSS (type-only store imports plus the
  relocated `seedanceReferenceRules` import match the packet contract),
  `git diff --check` passed with only LF/CRLF warnings, and
  `fc.exe /b AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md` passed.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P1-TYPES-BARREL-ROLE-SPLIT-145`; split `src/types/index.ts` into 11 role modules: timeline source, blend modes, timeline core, clip metadata, text, math scene, effects, engine stats, animation properties, masks, and keyframes.
  `index.ts` is now a compatibility re-export facade and dropped from 1194 to 550 raw lines.
  Runtime-handle-bearing compat types deliberately stay in `index.ts` so guard classification remains stable.
  Importer migration stays deferred.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 11 test files / 29 tests green (guard + mediaPanel + new importer/surface tests).
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P1B-SIGNAL-INTEGRATION-SCOUT-146`; read-only scout mapped universal import end-to-end.
  CSV and binary files already route from Media Panel import to timeline text-fallback render.
  Real gaps are direct timeline file drop being filtered out, media-biased pickers, missing JSON provider, and mobile ignoring signal assets.
  Proposed follow-up packets cover import surfaces, timeline drop, and JSON support.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 11 test files / 29 tests green (guard + mediaPanel + new importer/surface tests).
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-RESUME-SPLIT-147`; extracted classic-list derived-state planners into `src/components/panels/media/list/classicListPlanning.ts`.
  The new 392-line planner owns column-order persistence, badge/width planning, metadata labels, sort values, row flattening, and virtual range calculation.
  `MediaPanel.tsx` dropped from 4758 to 4396 raw lines.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 11 test files / 29 tests green (guard + mediaPanel + new importer/surface tests).
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P1B-SIGNAL-JSON-PROVIDER-148`; added JSON signal import support through `src/importers/json.ts` and `providers/jsonImporter.ts`.
  Provider priority is CSV 100, JSON 95, binary fallback -1000; `.json` and `.jsonl` assets include type, key/record counts, depth, histogram, preview, and parse mode.
  Invalid JSON delegates to binary fallback; fallback diagnostics add byte size, MIME, sniffed signature, and hex/ascii preview surfaced by `signalTextRendererAdapter`.
  JSON format-matrix status moved planned -> existing; summaries above 1 MiB are sampled estimates.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 11 test files / 29 tests green (guard + mediaPanel + new importer/surface tests).
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P1B-SIGNAL-IMPORT-SURFACE-149`; desktop import surfaces now accept any file while keeping Media Files first and `excludeAcceptAllOption: false` in the file-system picker.
  The Media Panel hidden input accept restriction is removed, and `MediaAddItemsMenu` wires "Import files..." through existing `onImport`.
  `MediaPanelHeader` and `MediaContextActionsMenu` pass the command through; routing stays unchanged through `importFilesWithPicker` / `importFiles` to the universal orchestrator.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 11 test files / 29 tests green (guard + mediaPanel + new importer/surface tests).
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P1B-SIGNAL-TIMELINE-FILE-DROP-151`; direct timeline drops of CSV/JSON/unknown-binary now import through the universal route and place via `addSignalAssetClip` at the drop position.
  Known media path stayed unchanged, asserted by the extended timeline drop placement test.
  `timelineExternalDropMediaResolver.ts` gained signal-aware `resolveTimelineDropImportResult`; `timelineExternalDropFilePlacement.ts` gained a signal placement helper routing only `unknown` classifications.
  `useExternalDrop.ts` received minimal pass-through wiring only; the existing `addSignalAssetClip` callback moved earlier and passed into placement actions.
  Protected-path grant was honored, and the full hook diff was reviewed by the orchestrator.
  Unknown/signal drops on audio tracks are skipped, matching panel-drag behavior; tests extended `tests/unit/timelineExternalDropFilePlacement.test.ts` to 5 tests including 2 signal cases and a known-media regression assertion.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 10 test files / 32 tests green (timeline drop, mediaPanel, guard, importer suites).
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-SPLIT-152`; extracted the search/filter derived-state cluster into `src/components/panels/media/panel/useMediaPanelProjectItems.ts`.
  The new 312-raw-line hook owns token parsing, project item aggregation, visible search ancestry, parent lookup, classic-list row derivation, and grid search/breadcrumb planning.
  `MediaPanel.tsx` reduced accordingly from about 4396 to about 4170 raw lines; worker reported 3924 to 3780 non-blank lines.
  Zero store or FlashBoard hits were introduced in the new file.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 10 test files / 32 tests green (timeline drop, mediaPanel, guard, importer suites).
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P1B-SIGNAL-MOBILE-SURFACE-153`; mobile reaches signal parity in `MobileMediaPanel.tsx` only.
  The import picker accepts any file, the mobile list shows `signalAssets` with an S-badge and kind/provider metadata, and tap placement works through existing `placeSignalAssetOnTimeline`.
  Placement targets the first video track; no store changes were made and eslint was clean.
  Known limitation: signal placement requires an existing video track and does not create one.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 10 test files / 32 tests green (timeline drop, mediaPanel, guard, importer suites).
- Incident note:
  During wave 2, `src/services/aiTools/handlers/stressTest.ts` and `fixtures/stress-test-media/README.md` disappeared from the worktree outside any packet write set.
  Worker session logs show all workers only observed the deletion and correctly reported the broken import instead of fixing it.
  The orchestrator restored both files from HEAD.
  Integrity rule added: workers never delete/revert outside write set; orchestrator checks git status before dispatch and commit.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 10 test files / 32 tests green (timeline drop, mediaPanel, guard, importer suites).
- Completed bounded packet:
  `RENAME-STRESS-TEST-155`; the legacy stress-test feature's old name was eliminated repo-wide (96 occurrences, 20 files).
  Handler/scripts/fixtures are now `stressTest.ts`,
  `prepare-stress-test-media.mjs`, `run-stress-test-bridge-fast.mjs`, and
  `fixtures/stress-test-media/`.
  NPM scripts, tool/symbol ids, `--skip-stress-test`, and docs/changelog prose now use stress-test naming.
  This includes `createStressTestProjectFixture`, `AITool:StressTest`,
  `fixtures:stress-test-media`, and `stress-test:bridge-fast`.
  Zero case-insensitive old-name hits remain, including filenames; `node
  --check` passed on all renamed scripts.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; FULL unit suite green (397 test files / 4130 tests, 59s).
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P1A-MEDIA-RUNTIME-CONTRACTS-156`; `src/services/mediaRuntime/contracts.ts`
  defines branded `RuntimeSourceId`, discriminated `MediaAssetRef`
  (media-file/signal/external origins), durable asset-ref-based
  `TimelineSourceRef` free of runtime ids, and `MediaRuntimeLease<RuntimeHandles>`.
  `types.ts` re-exports the contracts for import compatibility, and
  `tests/unit/mediaRuntimeContracts.test.ts` covers ref serializability via the
  persisted-state guard plus lease/runtime separation.
  Migration map recorded `blobUrlManager`, `sourceRuntimeSanitizer`,
  `webCodecsHelpers`, proxyFrameCache handle ownership, and projectLoad
  hydration handles with smallest later packet boundaries.
  This closes the two open Phase 1A contract/migration checklist items.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; FULL unit suite green (397 test files / 4130 tests, 59s).
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-SPLIT-157`; extracted the drag/drop/marquee controller into
  `src/components/panels/media/panel/useMediaPanelDragDropMarquee.ts`.
  The new 287-raw-line hook owns external drop import planning, panel/root
  drag-over state, internal item drag start/end, folder drop moves, and
  empty-space marquee behavior.
  `MediaPanel.tsx` is reduced to about 3950 raw lines and 3572 non-blank
  lines.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; FULL unit suite green (397 test files / 4130 tests, 59s).
- Runtime gate closed:
  Universal Signal end-to-end smoke PASSED via AI bridge in the real browser.
  `signal-smoke.csv` imported through `importLocalFiles` as type `signal`,
  placed on timeline track `video-2` via `addToTimeline`, and `placedClips`
  reported a signal clip.
  Render proof showed engine `layerCount=1` and the timeline canvas
  visible/drawn clips count at 3.
  This satisfies the Universal Signal runtime-proof criterion.
  `importLocalFiles` and `placeSignalAssetOnTimeline` already exist as bridge
  surface in `handlers/media.ts`.
- Runtime gate closed:
  P4 FlashBoard lane exit gate CLOSED after full app boot of the refactored
  Composer/store code with zero browser console errors and zero FlashBoard log
  anomalies.
  Closure includes the previously verified active-generation integration suites
  at 5 files and 16 tests.
  The UI-level composer click-through smoke is explicitly reassigned to Phase 7
  bridge-handler work because a composer driver tool does not exist yet.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P1-TYPES-BARREL-THIN-159`; `src/types/index.ts` is now a 133-raw-line
  re-export facade, under the 150-line target. Remaining clusters moved to
  `mediaSequences.ts` (51), `layers.ts` (95), `project.ts` (17), and
  `timeline.ts` (286). `foundationTypeTiers` classifications updated:
  `index.ts` runtime-handle maxCurrentHits lowered 21 -> 0; new
  compatibility-facade entries cover `mediaSequences` (2), `layers` (9), and
  `timeline` (10). Accepted debt: pure-moved inline
  `import('../stores|engine|services')` type expressions remain in
  `layers.ts`/`timeline.ts` under their hit ceilings.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 11 test files / 105 tests green (guards, mediaRuntime leases, mediaPanel, historyStore).
- Orchestrator ratchet:
  `foundationTypeBoundaryBaselines.globalTypesIndexRawLines` was ratcheted
  1194 -> 150 by the orchestrator; guard tests are green. The type-barrel goal
  criterion (barrel at target, ratchet updated downward) is MET.
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P1A-OBJECTURL-LEASE-MIGRATION-160`; added HMR-safe
  `mediaRuntimeObjectUrlLeaseOwner` in
  `src/services/mediaRuntime/objectUrlLeases.ts` (261 lines) with
  `RuntimeSourceId`-keyed leases, idempotent revoke, and leak
  accounting/diagnostics. `src/stores/timeline/helpers/blobUrlManager.ts` is
  now a 122-line delegating facade with the identical exported API; all 14 call
  sites were verified signature-compatible. Added
  `tests/unit/mediaRuntimeObjectUrlLease.test.ts`.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 11 test files / 105 tests green (guards, mediaRuntime leases, mediaPanel, historyStore).
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-MEDIA-PANEL-SPLIT-161`; extracted the view-mode transition/reveal
  controller to `media/panel/useMediaPanelViewTransition.ts` (355 lines,
  including DOM animation capture and cleanup). `MediaPanel.tsx` dropped from
  3974 to 3644 raw lines.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 11 test files / 105 tests green (guards, mediaRuntime leases, mediaPanel, historyStore).
- Completed read-only packet:
  `P2-GETSTATE-CLASSIFICATION-SCOUT-162`; delivered the accepted P2 freeze
  blueprint. It contains the complete class-(c) render-path/module-scope hard
  target list with file:line evidence, concentrated in `RenderDispatcher`,
  `LayerCollector`, `NestedCompRenderer`, `useEngine`, `renderScheduler`,
  `compositionRenderer`, `Preview.tsx`, properties tabs, and boot files. It
  also proposes allowed adapters (`aiTools`, guided actions, persistence,
  midi, sam2/matanyone, flashboard services, mediaRuntime, audio recording,
  export serialization, editorBoot), extends the runtime lease owner map to
  audio routing/manager, `ClipAudioRenderService`, thumbnail
  renderer/cacheService, `ScrubbingCache`, and `ParallelDecodeManager`, lists
  store split candidates (`dockStore` 1790, `historyStore` 1529,
  `fileManageSlice` 1309, `fileImportSlice` 812, `compositionSlice` 810), and
  proposes five P2 packets. The adapter list and runtime lease owner map are
  accepted at blueprint level; formal gate hardening remains
  `P2-GETSTATE-ADAPTER-FREEZE`.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 11 test files / 105 tests green (guards, mediaRuntime leases, mediaPanel, historyStore).
- Completed bounded packet:
  `P4-FLASHBOARD-CONTROLS-CSS-SPLIT-163`; split
  `FlashBoardControls.css` (1035 raw) at the `.fb-chat-panel` boundary into
  `FlashBoardControls.css` (630) plus new `FlashBoardChatControls.css` (405).
  The manifest import was added in cascade position; 76 unique class selectors
  were preserved exactly, and line conservation was exact.
  Orchestrator-verified: npx tsc -b clean; 11 test files / 105 tests green (guards, mediaRuntime leases, mediaPanel, historyStore).
- Next eligible packet: P1A webCodecsHelpers lease migration, next MediaPanel
  slice, then P2-GETSTATE-ADAPTER-FREEZE formalization.
- Product source refactors remain blocked outside approved packet write sets.

## How To Read Gates

Each phase gate is reviewable only when it has:

- [ ] gate id
- [ ] subchecks
- [ ] allowed write set
- [ ] forbidden files
- [ ] do-not rules
- [ ] focused checks or smoke commands
- [ ] exit criteria

A checked phase definition means the plan names the target. It does not mean
source implementation is complete. A gate is implementation-ready only when all
items above are explicit.

## Timeline Reuse Decision

- [x] Treat the completed timeline refactor as the method template.
- [x] Reuse the shapes for gate registry, lane write manifest, high-conflict
      ownership, retired-path ledger, adapter-debt ledger, test-migration
      ledger, exit-criteria coverage, and architecture-registry tests.
- [x] Protect timeline source from broad re-refactor work.
- [x] Define the future whole-codebase registry from the timeline method without
      copying timeline-specific ids.
- [ ] Define explicit integration packets before touching timeline source for
      project hydration, runtime leases, signals, or render/export snapshots.

## Plan Document

- [x] Define success criteria for maintainability, performance, and no god
      objects.
- [x] Define role-based LOC budgets with 700 LOC as product-source ceiling.
- [x] Define valid versus invalid splits.
- [x] Define dead-code and retired-path deletion policy.
- [x] Define master orchestrator execution model.
- [x] Define worker-agent packet format.
- [x] Define parallel-agent use for planning, implementation, verification, and
      cleanup waves.
- [x] Add actual codebase refactor phases based on current source scans.
- [x] Keep planning artifacts minimal: index + checklist + bounded phase files.
- [x] Split oversized phase details into bounded files while keeping
      `Complete-refactor.md` as the canonical index.
- [x] Prepare current handoff and handoff-history templates for execution.
- [x] Run 2 Codex and 2 Claude read-only plan-vs-codebase reviews.
- [x] Add agent review corrections to the actual plan.
- [x] Tighten phase gates into reviewable gate/subcheck blocks.
- [x] Add phase-level allowed write sets, forbidden files, and do-not rules.
- [x] Add max-6 parallel execution wave plan with sequenced shared hubs.
- [x] Add progress/commit/check cadence: coherent checkpoint commits, focused
      packet checks, full build/lint/test only when AGENTS.md requires it.
- [ ] Convert all gate/subcheck blocks into exact test/static-check names.
- [x] Convert P0/P1 gates into exact static-check ids and command names.
- [ ] Add packet-level high-conflict write sets for all phases.
- [x] Add P0/P1 packet-level high-conflict ownership and forbidden sets.
- [x] Queue first source/tooling packets with write sets, checks, and stop
      conditions.
- [x] Add first implementation packets after skeptical review.

## Progress And Check Cadence

- [x] Preserve progress in coherent packets, not random file-edit commits.
- [x] Prefer focused gates, targeted tests, static scans, and smokes during
      implementation.
- [x] Do not run full `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run test` after
      every small edit.
- [x] Run the full chain for normal commit, push, release, merge, or explicit
      final readiness as required by `AGENTS.md`.
- [x] Use `fast commit`/`fast push` rules only when the user explicitly requests
      that command mode.
- [x] Add packet-level checkpoint policy to the first implementation packet.

## Reviewable Gate Matrix

This matrix is the user-visible "what not to do yet" control surface. Source
implementation must not start for a phase until its relevant gate block is
complete enough for the packet.

- [ ] `P1_RUNTIME_HANDLES_FORBIDDEN_IN_SHARED_SCHEMA`
  - [x] runtime-handle scan covers shared schema and broad type barrels
  - [x] new unclassified runtime-handle hits fail
        `tests/unit/foundationTypeBoundary.test.ts`
  - [x] project schema runtime-handle hits are rejected by

  - [x] existing `src/types/index.ts` runtime-handle debt removed by
        `P1-TYPES-BARREL-THIN-159`; accepted compatibility-facade hits remain
        in role modules under guard ceilings
  - [x] project sequence-frame `File` hydration debt removed by
        `P3-HYDRATION-ADAPTER-001`

### P1A - Clip And Media Source Runtime Split

Allowed write set:

- `src/types/**`
- `src/services/mediaRuntime/**`
- targeted runtime-boundary tests

Forbidden files:

- `src/components/panels/MediaPanel.tsx`
- `src/services/project/projectLoad.ts`
- `src/services/project/projectSave.ts`
- `src/engine/render/RenderDispatcher.ts`
- `src/components/export/ExportPanel.tsx`

Gates and subchecks:

- [x] `P1A_CLIP_SOURCE_DURABLE_RUNTIME_SPLIT`
  - [x] durable clip/source refs contain ids/metadata only
  - [x] runtime lookup uses `RuntimeSourceId`
- [x] `P1A_MEDIA_FILE_RUNTIME_SIDETABLE`
  - [x] `File`, object URL, DOM, frame, decoder, and GPU handles have owners
- [x] `P1A_SINGLE_RUNTIME_LEASE_DOMAIN`
  - [x] existing `services/mediaRuntime` registry is canonical
  - [x] no second lease manager introduced
- [x] `P1A_RUNTIME_HANDLE_ROUNDTRIP_GUARD`
  - [x] `structuredClone` guard defined
  - [x] JSON roundtrip guard defined
  - [x] `file`, `url`, `handle`, and runtime object leak cases covered
- [x] `P1A_HMR_SAFE_RUNTIME_OWNER`
  - [x] singleton/HMR survival pattern defined for new runtime owners

Execution state:

- [x] `src/services/mediaRuntime/types.ts` defines `MediaAssetRef`,
      `TimelineSourceRef`, `MediaRuntimeLease`, `RuntimeSourceId`, and
      `RenderFrameSource`.
- [x] `src/services/mediaRuntime/leaseOwnership.ts` maps every runtime handle
      kind to canonical `services/mediaRuntime` ownership and records legacy
      migration sources.
- [x] `src/services/mediaRuntime/persistedStateGuard.ts` rejects live handles
      through `structuredClone`, JSON roundtrip, runtime-field, object URL, and
      runtime-object checks.
- [x] `src/services/mediaRuntime/objectUrlLeases.ts` owns HMR-safe
      `RuntimeSourceId` object-URL leases, revoke idempotency, and leak
      accounting; `blobUrlManager.ts` is a compatibility facade over that
      owner.
- [x] Focused check passed:
      `npm run test -- tests/unit/persistedStateRuntimeHandles.test.ts tests/unit/mediaRuntimeLeaseContracts.test.ts tests/unit/foundationTypeBoundary.test.ts tests/unit/completeArchitectureRegistry.test.ts tests/unit/timelineArchitectureRegistry.test.ts`.
- [ ] Legacy `MediaFile.file` and existing clip runtime fields remain
      compatibility debt for the P2/P3 store-project freeze; they were not
      removed in P1A.

Do not:

- [ ] Do not remove `MediaFile.file` before side-table migration exists.
- [ ] Do not add lease logic outside `services/mediaRuntime`.
- [ ] Do not touch MediaPanel/project/render/export to close this phase.

Execution state:

- [x] `src/signals/formatMatrix.ts` defines the June-2026 format matrix for
      3D, PDF/SVG, CAD, JSON/CSV, binary/unknown, and point-cloud families.
- [x] `tests/unit/signals/signalFormatMatrix.test.ts` verifies runtime-free
      signal files, format coverage, fallback policy, and project-shaped signal
      DTO roundtrip.
- [x] Existing importer and renderer adapter fixtures stayed green:
      `tests/unit/importers/universalImportOrchestrator.test.ts`,
      `tests/unit/signals/signalTimelineRendererAdapter.test.ts`, and
      `tests/unit/signals/signalTextRendererAdapter.test.ts`.
- [x] Focused check passed:
      `npm run test -- tests/unit/signals/signalContracts.test.ts tests/unit/signals/signalFormatMatrix.test.ts tests/unit/importers/universalImportOrchestrator.test.ts tests/unit/signals/signalTimelineRendererAdapter.test.ts tests/unit/signals/signalTextRendererAdapter.test.ts tests/unit/completeArchitectureRegistry.test.ts`.
- [ ] Project load/save integration remains deferred to
      `P1-P3-SCHEMA-FREEZE-001`; P1B only proved the signal DTO contract and
      project-shaped JSON roundtrip.

Do not:

- [ ] Do not solve signals with one-off Media Panel UI branches.
- [ ] Do not put runtime handles in signal DTOs.
- [ ] Do not claim CAD/PDF/SVG/3D support complete with binary summary only.
